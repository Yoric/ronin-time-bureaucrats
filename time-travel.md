# Time Travel

Technologically, Time Travel is quite simple. It involves bombarding a core of `[REDACTED]` with a steady flux of `[REDACTED]-[REDACTED]` until it `[REDACTED]`, then letting it `[REDACTED]` for `[REDACTED]`. Nothing that couldn't have been invented with the materials available during `[REDACTED]`! Now, aiming is a little more complicated. The best technology known to this day  requires a the full `[REDACTED]`of a `[REDACTED]`, and a `[REDACTED]` to improve `[REDACTED]`. As you may imagine, such `[REDACTED]` may only be found `[REDACTED]`, which understandably does tend to limit the number of Continuum Indirections in this Continuum – and from there, the number of Time Travelers!



Time Travel is simple. Hop into your Indirection, point it to coordinates in the current Continuum and press the button. Barring any problem, a few subjective minutes later, you’ll have arrived.

Indirections take all sorts of forms, depending on the whim of the Bureaucracy and the Designer. For instance:

* The **Time Brigade** variant of the Bureaucracy tends to prefer huge buildings of concrete featuring prominent eagles, and hosting a few Bureaucrats, a few Polymorphic Provocateurs and thousands of Crowd-Control Automatons.
* On the other hand, the **Time Library** has employed hand-held Indirections that let Bureaucrats simply walk from any library in Time and Space \(in a pinch, a large enough bookshop will do\) to any other one through temporary L-Dimensional tunnels.
* Even more stealthy, the **Time Museum** hides Indirections inside pieces of art that can easily travel between public and private collections, including manuscripts and paintings, and uses Myp-Morphism to let the Bureaucrats discreetly enter or leave their mostly bidimensional Indirection.
* The ambitious **Time Federation**, has ordered hundreds of Spacecraft Indirections, designed to travel the \(somewhat\) slow way across the universe, orbit around planets, and teleport Bureaucrats from and to the surface. Unfortunately, teleportation has been known to be subject to GM \(Gamma Mesons, of course\) Interference at the most inconvenient times.
* The opulent agents of the **Time Hanse** could never manage to travel without their riches. After a few attempts at designing something more portable, they gave up and used city-sized Indirections, full with employees, factories and hangars.
* Contractually, the shady **Union of Time Private Detectives** must have their office above or behind Chinese Restaurants. To simplify things, their Indirection generally contains both the office and the Chinese Restaurant, and upon landing, will try to integrate to an existing building. Such Indirections have been known to accidentally trap clients busy eating at the Restaurant, but so far, nobody has complained.
* Etc.

It has been noticed that, regardless of time and space, the so-called Time Plebeians \(aka non-Time Travelers\) do not seem to care all that much about the appearance of a new shop, piece of art, building or even city, so after a time, Indirection engineers gave up on attempts at camouflage and just rolled with it.

While Indirections can go nearly anywhere in time and space, a few places have proved impossible \(so far\) to approach: the Big Bang, the Big Crunch and quite a few smaller Bangs and Crunches. Scientists theorise that the laws of physics are sufficiently different at these coordinates that Indirections just can’t reach them.

Of course, problems with Time Travel are not unusual and Bureaucrats regularly end up on planets and time periods that they had no intention of reaching. Again, this is theorised to be the cause of Gamma Meson Interference. In particular, Indirections have been known to travel to alternate universes. While this is actually quite easy to do, experience shows that it is extremely hard to do _on purpose_.

## Paradoxes and Pocket Continuums

One of the main risks of Time Travel is the Paradox. Any action by a Time Traveller can theoretically have extreme consequences on the Continuum.

This has been formulated as the Axiom of Observable Contradictions:

* An action by Time Travellers on Time causes Paradox if and only if it is causes a contradiction observable by any Time Traveller \(including the ones who caused the action or will cause the action\) at another set of coordinates.
* An apparent contradiction that can somehow be explained reasonably enough to be waved away is not really an Observable Contradiction and will therefore not cause Paradox.

For instance:

* Killing your Grandfather is not a good idea, as this causes the Observable Contradiction of you not existing at a past set of coordinates.
* However, if there is a reason to believe that your Grandmother lied to your parents about the identity of your Grandfather, everything is ok, because there is no Observable Contradiction, just a further indication that your Grandmother could really not be trusted. But then, with her past working as a Corporate Acquisition Lawyer, you already knew about that.
* If your Grandmother didn’t lie, perhaps the man who sired your parent was an imposter? Perhaps a Polymorphic Provocateur of the Time Brigades? If you can somehow make it likely, there is no Observable Contradiction, just odd looks from the rest of your Crew.
* Now, if other hypotheses are unreasonable, you have create a Pocket Continuum.

As it turns out, Paradoxes can very well exist in the universe, although generating a Paradox is seldom in your own interest:

* Paradoxes cause Pocket Continuums.
* Naturally, a Pocket Continuums will tend to fold upon itself and vanish very quickly, with everything and everyone who happened to be in the Continuum at the time.
* Importing materials and Time Energy to a Pocket Continuum will strengthen it, possibly turning it into an alternate Continuum. Conversely, exporting materials and Time Energy from a Continuum will sap it, eventually turning it into an unstable Pocket Continuum.

E

You may wish to remain in this Continuum, in which your parent was never born, nor were you, but unless you find a very good way to strengthen it, it will quickly implode. You may survive the implosion if you are in your Indirection at the time.

* If you really, really want the Pocket Continuum to survive, you will have to strengthen it. If you can somehow lure many Time Travellers \(perhaps by importing a whole section of the Time Cold War?\) into your Pocket Continuum, it will eventually become a full-fledged Continuum. With more effort, you could even erase the Continuum in which your Grandfather survived.

## Life and Death of a Bureaucrat

An important consequence of the Axiom of Observable Contradictions is that Time Travellers \(and people aware of Time Travel\) tend to take extreme measures to avoid killing anyone, in particular other Time Travellers. Killing a Time Traveller \(or, if you are a Time Traveller, killing a time-immobile witness\) tends to cause all sorts of unexpected Observable Contradictions, which in turn has pretty good chances of trapping you in a Pocket Continuum from which you might not be able to escape.

Corollaries:

* If there is a chance that the Time Travellers died, generally, it turned out that they didn’t, because this story is set in the Continuum in which they didn’t die.
* If there is a chance that the Time Traveller killed someone, generally, it turned out that they didn’t, because this story is set in the Continuum in which they didn’t die.
* If you Have a Plan to make your killing stick, ignore the above.
