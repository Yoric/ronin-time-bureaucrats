# Time Travel

Technologically, Time Travel is quite simple. It involves bombarding a core of `[REDACTED]` with a steady flux of `[REDACTED]-[REDACTED]` until it `[REDACTED]`, then letting it `[REDACTED]` for `[REDACTED]`. Nothing that couldn't have been invented with the materials available during `[REDACTED]`! Now, aiming is a little more complicated. The best technology known to this day  requires a the full `[REDACTED]`of a `[REDACTED]`, and a `[REDACTED]` to improve `[REDACTED]`. As you may imagine, such `[REDACTED]` may only be found `[REDACTED]`, which understandably does tend to limit the number of Continuum Indirections in this Continuum – and from there, the number of Time Travelers!

Also, while most people can enter a Continuum Indirection without problem, please make sure to visit a doctor every few trips, to ensure that you do not experience Space·Time Allergy, or worse, the Space·Time Rejection Syndrome.

## Where can I go?

Well, pretty much anywhere you want. With an up-to-date Continuum Indirection, nearly all of Space·Time is within your reach. Continuum Indirections travel thanks to the `[REDACTED]` effect, which means that you can reach Space·Time coordinates even if a traditional 4D path would have taken you through solid matter. The travel itself may take a few seconds – or, in some cases, a few minutes – _et voilà_!

Now, there are some limitations to where your Continuum Indirection can take you:

1. Most Laws of Physics degrade seriously when approaching either the Big Bang or the Big Crunch. The second corollary of the Law of `[REDACTED]` determines that a Continuum Indirection may not travel before the Afterglow \(any time between the Big Bang and BB + 375,000 years\) or after the Black Density of the Universe reaches approximately _10^-16_ \(also known as Big Black Horizon\).
2. For the same reasons, Continuum Indirections may not travel to or through Smaller Bangs and Smaller Crunches.
3. Similarly, the seventh corollary of the Law of `[REDACTED]` clearly determines that Continuum Indirections cannot escape from a High-Gravity Curvature, such as the close proximity of a Black Hole, the inside of a star, or the heart of a planet. For these reasons, your Continuum Indirection is programmed to automatically avoid such Space·Time coordinates. Not that you would survive in one, anyway.
4. Technically, a Continuum Indirection may materialize at the same coordinates as a body, including most gases, liquids and solids. The Continuum Indirection will _displace_ this body, as proved by `[REDACTED`\]'s corrolary of `[REDACTED]`'s well known Law. However, while displacing gases, liquids or plasmas is generally mostly safe, displacing solids tends to pulverise them. All Continuum Indirections are equipped with advanced `[REDACTED]` that strongly decrease the probability displacing sentient creatures. However, caution is suggested.
5. Sufficiently dense Gamma Meson bombardments have been known to play havoc on the `[REDACTED]` of Continuum Indirections, which may theoretically end up with your Continuum Indirection landing at Space·Time coordinates slightly different from those you had in mind. However, don't let this scare you. The probability of encountering a dense Gamma Meson bombardment in the entirety of Space·Time is so infinitesimally small that you could spend millenia traveling with your Continuum Indirection without encountering a single one! 
6. On occasion, Continuum Indirections have been known to travel to and from alternate universes. While this is actually quite easy to do, experience shows that it is extremely hard to do _on purpose_.

## What does my Continuum Indirection look like?

Since you are a Ronin Time Bureaucrat, the aspect and features of your Continuum Indirection depends a lot of where it comes from, and how you have customized it since you, er, eloped.

A wide host of different technologies afford of Continuum Indirections that look like, well, pretty much anything. It may be a spaceship as well as a a bathtub, a restaurant as well as a book, or a map, or a corridor or a sports car, or, well, did we mention pretty much anything? And yes, it may be larger on the inside, although it doesn't have to.

Many – though not all – Continuum Indirections are also designed to allow communications through Space·Time. There are, however, dozens – if not hundreds – of incompatible Space·Time communication technologies, not counting the local space-communication techniques developed by natives, which explains why having a phone conversation through Space·Time is generally much harder than simply walking to discuss face-to-face with your interlocutor.

It has been noticed that, regardless of time and space, the so-called Time Plebeians \(aka non-Time Travelers\) do not seem to care all that much about the appearance of a new shop, piece of art, building or even city, so after a time, Indirection engineers gave up on attempts at camouflage and just rolled with it.

## Paradoxes and Pocket Continuums

Many things can happen in time without any kind of consequence. Do you wish to teach the 5th Symphony to Beethoven? Not a problem. Step on a butterfly? Most likely not a problem, either. Give the Mona Lisa a [moustache](https://www.dalipaintings.com/self-portrait-mona-lisa.jsp) while Leonardo Da Vinci is asleep? Chances are that he's going to fix the issue tomorrow morning. Kill baby Hitler or your grandfather? Ah, that might be a problem. Or then, it might not.

This has been formulated as the Law of Observable Contradictions.

* An action by a Time Traveler \(or a group of Time Travelers\) increases Paradox if and only if it causes a contradiction with respect to whatever that Time Traveler has observed in their subjective past.
* However, if the apparent observable contradiction that may be explained reasonably enough to be waved away will cause little-to-no Paradox increase.
* Too much Paradox will eventually cause the local Continuum to fold into a Pocket Continuum. That is not good.

Example:

* Time Traveler Tom just shot the Big Bad Masked Man, without realizing that, behind the mask, Big Bad Masked Man was also Grandfather Gerry, before he met Grandmother Greta.

* Apparently, this is an Observable Contradiction. If left untreated, it will damage cause Paradox, damaging the Continuum.

* Paradox is bad. Time Traveler Tom doesn't like Paradox. So Time Traveler Tom will attempt to Explain the Apparent Contradiction.

* Time Traveler Tom argues that Grandmother Greta has always been a compulsive drunk, who had sex with just about any stranger. She was also a compulsive liar. So, there are very good chances that Grandmother Greta had no clue who Time Traveler Tom's grandfather really was, and just used the picture of a random man.

* Time Traveler Tina adds that she volunteers to slip that picture to Grandmother Greta, at some point in the future.

* Finally, Time Traveler Tom adds that he's pretty sure his mother never asked question about her father because Grandmother Greta had always told her that Grandfather Gerry was a violent and unstable man.

* Is this a sufficient Explanation? We'll see...

### The Law of Observable Contradictions

One of the main risks of Time Travel is the Paradox. Any action by a Time Traveller can theoretically have extreme consequences on the Continuum.

This has been formulated as the Axiom of Observable Contradictions:

* An action by Time Travellers on Time causes Paradox if and only if it is causes a contradiction observable by any Time Traveller \(including the ones who caused the action or will cause the action\) at another set of coordinates.
* An apparent contradiction that can somehow be explained reasonably enough to be waved away is not really an Observable Contradiction and will therefore not cause Paradox.

### Killing your own grand-father

For instance:

* Killing your Grandfather is not a good idea, as this causes the Observable Contradiction of you not existing at a past set of coordinates.
* However, if there is a reason to believe that your Grandmother lied to your parents about the identity of your Grandfather, everything is ok, because there is no Observable Contradiction, just a further indication that your Grandmother could really not be trusted. But then, with her past working as a Corporate Acquisition Lawyer, you already knew about that.
* If your Grandmother didn’t lie, perhaps the man who sired your parent was an imposter? Perhaps a Polymorphic Provocateur of the Time Brigades? If you can somehow make it likely, there is no Observable Contradiction, just odd looks from the rest of your Crew.
* Now, if other hypotheses are unreasonable, you have create a Pocket Continuum.

### Circular symphonies

### Pocket Continuums

As it turns out, Paradoxes can very well exist in the universe, although generating a Paradox is seldom in your own interest:

* Paradoxes cause Pocket Continuums.
* Naturally, a Pocket Continuums will tend to fold upon itself and vanish very quickly, with everything and everyone who happened to be in the Continuum at the time.
* Importing materials and Time Energy to a Pocket Continuum will strengthen it, possibly turning it into an alternate Continuum. Conversely, exporting materials and Time Energy from a Continuum will sap it, eventually turning it into an unstable Pocket Continuum.

You may wish to remain in this Continuum, in which your parent was never born, nor were you, but unless you find a very good way to strengthen it, it will quickly implode. You may survive the implosion if you are in your Indirection at the time.

* If you really, really want the Pocket Continuum to survive, you will have to strengthen it. If you can somehow lure many Time Travellers \(perhaps by importing a whole section of the Time Cold War?\) into your Pocket Continuum, it will eventually become a full-fledged Continuum. With more effort, you could even erase the Continuum in which your Grandfather survived.

### Killing off Bureaucrats

An important consequence of the Axiom of Observable Contradictions is that Time Travellers \(and people aware of Time Travel\) tend to take extreme measures to avoid killing anyone, in particular other Time Travellers. Killing a Time Traveller \(or, if you are a Time Traveller, killing a time-immobile witness\) tends to cause all sorts of unexpected Observable Contradictions, which in turn has pretty good chances of trapping you in a Pocket Continuum from which you might not be able to escape.

Corollaries:

* If there is a chance that the Time Travellers died, generally, it turned out that they didn’t, because this story is set in the Continuum in which they didn’t die.
* If there is a chance that the Time Traveller killed someone, generally, it turned out that they didn’t, because this story is set in the Continuum in which they didn’t die.
* If you Have a Plan to make your killing stick, ignore the above.
