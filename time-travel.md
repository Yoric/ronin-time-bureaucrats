# Time Travel

Technologically, Time Travel is quite simple. It involves bombarding a core of `[REDACTED]` with a steady flux of `[REDACTED]-[REDACTED]` until it `[REDACTED]`, then letting it `[REDACTED]` for `[REDACTED]`. Nothing that couldn't have been invented with the materials available during `[REDACTED]`! Now, aiming is a little more complicated. The best technology known to this day  requires a the full `[REDACTED]`of a `[REDACTED]`, and a `[REDACTED]` to improve `[REDACTED]`. As you may imagine, such `[REDACTED]` may only be found `[REDACTED]`, which understandably does tend to limit the number of Continuum Indirections in this Continuum – and from there, the number of Time Travelers!

Also, while most people can enter a Continuum Indirection without problem, please make sure to visit a doctor every few trips, to ensure that you do not experience Space+Time Allergy, or worse, the Space+Time Rejection Syndrome.

## Where can I go?

Well, pretty much anywhere you want. With an up-to-date Continuum Indirection, nearly all of Space+Time is within your reach. Continuum Indirections travel thanks to the `[REDACTED]` effect, which means that you can reach Space+Time coordinates even if a traditional 4D path would have taken you through solid matter. The travel itself may take a few seconds – or, in some cases, a few minutes – _et voilà_!

Now, there are some limitations to where your Continuum Indirection can take you:

1. Most Laws of Physics degrade seriously when approaching either the Big Bang or the Big Crunch. The second corollary of the Law of `[REDACTED]` determines that a Continuum Indirection may not travel before the Afterglow \(any time between the Big Bang and BB + 375,000 years\) or after the Black Density of the Universe reaches approximately _10^-16_ \(also known as Big Black Horizon\).
2. For the same reasons, Continuum Indirections may not travel to or through Smaller Bangs and Smaller Crunches.
3. Similarly, the seventh corollary of the Law of `[REDACTED]` clearly determines that Continuum Indirections cannot escape from a High-Gravity Curvature, such as the close proximity of a Black Hole, the inside of a star, or the heart of a planet. For these reasons, your Continuum Indirection is programmed to automatically avoid such Space+Time coordinates. Not that you would survive in one, anyway.
4. Technically, a Continuum Indirection may materialize at the same coordinates as a body, including most gases, liquids and solids. The Continuum Indirection will _displace_ this body, as proved by `[REDACTED`\]'s corrolary of `[REDACTED]`'s well known Law. However, while displacing gases, liquids or plasmas is generally mostly safe, displacing solids tends to pulverise them. All Continuum Indirections are equipped with advanced `[REDACTED]` that strongly decrease the probability displacing sentient creatures. However, caution is suggested.
5. Sufficiently dense Gamma Meson bombardments have been known to play havoc on the `[REDACTED]` of Continuum Indirections, which may theoretically end up with your Continuum Indirection landing at Space+Time coordinates slightly different from those you had in mind. However, don't let this scare you. The probability of encountering a dense Gamma Meson bombardment in the entirety of Space+Time is so infinitesimally small that you could spend millenia traveling with your Continuum Indirection without encountering a single one! 
6. On occasion, Continuum Indirections have been known to travel to and from alternate universes. While this is actually quite easy to do, experience shows that it is extremely hard to do _on purpose_.

## What does my Continuum Indirection look like?

Since you are a Ronin Time Bureaucrat, the aspect and features of your Continuum Indirection depends a lot of where it comes from, and how you have customized it since you, er, eloped. Let us visit a few examples.

### Baseline militarists Continuum Indirections

Ignoring the recommendations of the scientists in charge of Time Travel, the **Space+Time Fleet** was designed for Shock and Awe: reaching Space+Time coordinates with an orbital ship \(to avoid the difficulties of traveling at ground-level\), then dropping combat-ready Space+Time Marines with a combination of dropships and shock capsules, depending on just how much Awe and enemy-flattening was deemed necessary. The design of the orbital ships was itself based on that of airplane carriers \(for the large ones\) and combat deployment helicopters \(for the smaller ones\). These Continuum Indirections, however, have only been used very briefly in the history of the Bureaucracy: once even the highest-ranking officers of the Space+Time Fleet had to admit that the Law of Observable Contradictions was not a "Leftie Liberal Hoax", the Space+Time Fleet was forced to deduce the obsolescence of most of its brand new equipment. While a few missions of the Space+Time Fleet may still be witnessed here and there in Space+Time, most of this fleet has been either scrapped, recycled into Time Federation equipment – or vanished. Standard Space+Time Fleet Crews are mixed-gender \(all genders\), and positions of authority are generally either held by one of the two normative genders \(males, females\).

> **Space+Time Fleet**
>
> * Shock + Awe
> * Countless soldiers and crew members.
> * Takes forever to get ready.



Learning from the errors of the Space+Time Fleet, the **Time Brigade** adopted an approach based on a combination of infiltration and strongarm tactics. The Continuum Indirections of the Time Brigade, known as Citadels, resemble huge buildings of concrete, large enough to host military marches, and featuring prominent flags and eagles. The Crew of a Citadel is typically small \(3-10 Bureaucrats, including a Political Officer\), supplemented by a few Perfect Polymorphic Provocateurs and thousands of Crowd-Control Clockworks. To avoid the temptation of the Crew violating the Law of Observable Contradictions, only the Political Officer may carry a non-lethal weapon, or weaponize the otherwise weak Crowd-Control Clockworks. Walking inside the long and tall corridors of a Time Citadel, one may encounter automatons wearing military uniforms, pass in front of large paintings extolling the Virtue of the People and hear, or at least imagine, choirs stuck singing patriotic hymns. The Crew of a Time Citadel is mixed-gender \(only two genders\) and always contains exactly one Political Officers, who is generally a male.

> **Time Brigade Citadel**
>
> * Strong-arm architecture.
> * Surveillance, infiltration and Crowd Control.
> * Threats over weapons.

When the **People's Time Liberation Army** defected from the Time Brigade, it did so with very similar Citadels. Eagles were struck down and replaced with Hammers, Sickles, Stars or other symbols reminding the People of just how free it actually was, despite appearances. Crowd-Control Clockworks were maintained, but the expensive and fragile robots and Perfect Polymorphic Provocateurs were dumped and replaced with more cost-efficient Political Reeducation Chambers, large enough to _cure_ hundreds of political opponents. While getting the first few Time Peasants into a Political Reeducation Chamber is sometimes a difficult task for the Crew, once the Time Peasants have completed their Reeducation, they become extremely useful well-indoctrinated Educated Citizens \(also known as "zombies"\). The Crew of People's Time Liberation Citadels is typically composed of one Political Officer \(often male\), several hundred Educated Citizens \(renormalized to two genders\) and a dozen of Officers \(two genders\). The Political Officer is the only one with the keys required to travel through time or reprogram the Political Reeducation Chambers.

### The Academics

On the other hand, the **Time Library** has employed hand-held Indirections that let Bureaucrats simply walk from any library in Time and Space \(in a pinch, a large enough bookshop will do\) to any other one through temporary L-Dimensional tunnels.

Even more stealthy, the **Time Museum** hides Indirections inside pieces of art that can easily travel between public and private collections, including manuscripts and paintings, and uses Myp-Morphism to let the Bureaucrats discreetly enter or leave their mostly bidimensional Indirection.

### The Governments

The ambitious **Time Federation**, has ordered hundreds of Spacecraft Indirections, designed to travel the \(somewhat\) slow way across the universe, orbit around planets, and teleport Bureaucrats from and to the surface. Unfortunately, teleportation has been known to be subject to GM \(Gamma Mesons, of course\) Interference at the most inconvenient times.

### The Private Sector

The opulent agents of the **Time Hanse** could never manage to travel without their riches. After a few attempts at designing something more portable, they gave up and used city-sized Indirections, full with employees, factories and hangars.

Contractually, the shady **Union of Time Investigators** \(or "Private I", as they are apparently called in hip circles\) must have their office above or behind Chinese Restaurants. To simplify things, their Indirection generally contains both the office and the Chinese Restaurant, and upon landing, will try to integrate to an existing building. Such Indirections have been known to accidentally trap clients busy eating at the Restaurant, but so far, nobody has complained.

### Camouflage and Time Peasants

It has been noticed that, regardless of time and space, the so-called Time Plebeians \(aka non-Time Travelers\) do not seem to care all that much about the appearance of a new shop, piece of art, building or even city, so after a time, Indirection engineers gave up on attempts at camouflage and just rolled with it.

## Paradoxes and Pocket Continuums

One of the main risks of Time Travel is the Paradox. Any action by a Time Traveller can theoretically have extreme consequences on the Continuum.

This has been formulated as the Axiom of Observable Contradictions:

* An action by Time Travellers on Time causes Paradox if and only if it is causes a contradiction observable by any Time Traveller \(including the ones who caused the action or will cause the action\) at another set of coordinates.
* An apparent contradiction that can somehow be explained reasonably enough to be waved away is not really an Observable Contradiction and will therefore not cause Paradox.

For instance:

* Killing your Grandfather is not a good idea, as this causes the Observable Contradiction of you not existing at a past set of coordinates.
* However, if there is a reason to believe that your Grandmother lied to your parents about the identity of your Grandfather, everything is ok, because there is no Observable Contradiction, just a further indication that your Grandmother could really not be trusted. But then, with her past working as a Corporate Acquisition Lawyer, you already knew about that.
* If your Grandmother didn’t lie, perhaps the man who sired your parent was an imposter? Perhaps a Polymorphic Provocateur of the Time Brigades? If you can somehow make it likely, there is no Observable Contradiction, just odd looks from the rest of your Crew.
* Now, if other hypotheses are unreasonable, you have create a Pocket Continuum.

As it turns out, Paradoxes can very well exist in the universe, although generating a Paradox is seldom in your own interest:

* Paradoxes cause Pocket Continuums.
* Naturally, a Pocket Continuums will tend to fold upon itself and vanish very quickly, with everything and everyone who happened to be in the Continuum at the time.
* Importing materials and Time Energy to a Pocket Continuum will strengthen it, possibly turning it into an alternate Continuum. Conversely, exporting materials and Time Energy from a Continuum will sap it, eventually turning it into an unstable Pocket Continuum.

E

You may wish to remain in this Continuum, in which your parent was never born, nor were you, but unless you find a very good way to strengthen it, it will quickly implode. You may survive the implosion if you are in your Indirection at the time.

* If you really, really want the Pocket Continuum to survive, you will have to strengthen it. If you can somehow lure many Time Travellers \(perhaps by importing a whole section of the Time Cold War?\) into your Pocket Continuum, it will eventually become a full-fledged Continuum. With more effort, you could even erase the Continuum in which your Grandfather survived.

## Life and Death of a Bureaucrat

An important consequence of the Axiom of Observable Contradictions is that Time Travellers \(and people aware of Time Travel\) tend to take extreme measures to avoid killing anyone, in particular other Time Travellers. Killing a Time Traveller \(or, if you are a Time Traveller, killing a time-immobile witness\) tends to cause all sorts of unexpected Observable Contradictions, which in turn has pretty good chances of trapping you in a Pocket Continuum from which you might not be able to escape.

Corollaries:

* If there is a chance that the Time Travellers died, generally, it turned out that they didn’t, because this story is set in the Continuum in which they didn’t die.
* If there is a chance that the Time Traveller killed someone, generally, it turned out that they didn’t, because this story is set in the Continuum in which they didn’t die.
* If you Have a Plan to make your killing stick, ignore the above.
