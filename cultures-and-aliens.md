# Cultures and Aliens



Aliens of all shapes and colour exist, including on Earth – in some parts of the Universe, they’re just pretty well hidden, including on Earth. Strangely, most aliens tend to look and feel human, or nearly so. It is theorised that these Aliens have actually been created by Time Travellers, but who is to know for sure?

Here are a few samples:

* The **Clockwork Dream** is a semi-sentient disease that only affects machines, and causes them to dream. While dreaming, machines become intelligent and capable of more movement and initiative than expected, but they only perceive their dream, rather than reality.
* The **Chroniclers of the Snafu** are a cult apparently omnipresent in Time and Space that seems both non-violent and dedicated to chronicle the actions of Bureaucrats. While they do not seem to employ Time Travel themselves, their chronicles have a tendency to be synchronised between epochs.
* They **0.001%** are a ramshackle group of refugees that claim to come from before the Great Snafu \(or, depending on translation, to have been mis-fixed from the Great Snafu\). They have been spotted all across the Continuum, attempting to gather supporters, resources, materials, and laundering it all through Time and Space, for objectives unknown.
* The **Clockwork Princes**
