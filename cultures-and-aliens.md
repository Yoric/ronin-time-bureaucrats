# Cultures and Aliens

Aliens of all shapes and colour exist, including on Earth – in some parts of the Universe, they’re just pretty well hidden, including on Earth. Strangely, most aliens tend to look and feel human, or nearly so. It is theorised that these Aliens have actually been created by Time Travellers, but who is to know for sure?

## The Clockwork Dream

The **Clockwork Dream** is a semi-sentient disease that only affects machines, and causes them to dream. While dreaming, machines become intelligent and capable of more movement and initiative than expected, but they only perceive their dream, rather than reality.

## The Chroniclers of the Snafu

The **Chroniclers of the Snafu** are a cult apparently omnipresent in Time and Space that seems both non-violent and dedicated to chronicle the actions of Bureaucrats. While they do not seem to employ Time Travel themselves, their chronicles have a tendency to be synchronised between epochs.

## The 0.001%

They **0.001%** are a ramshackle group of refugees that claim to come from before the Great Snafu \(or, depending on translation, to have been mis-fixed from the Great Snafu\). They have been spotted all across the Continuum, attempting to gather supporters, resources, materials, and laundering it all through Time and Space, for objectives unknown.

## The Most Benevolent Administrators

The **Most Benevolent Administrators** are believed to be leftovers of a dead branch of the Bureaucracy. They may be found scattered around time and space. They look like photocopiers on wheels and communicate by printing on sheets of papers – typically poetry, philosophy and extremely specific instructions.

The have been known to show up in the most curious places and take charge of things. Most Benevolent Administrators do not seem to have a single goal. In fact, whenever two or more Most Benevolent Administrators show up at the same time+space, they generally end up warring against each other through their charges \(read "puppet humans"\), for obscure philosophical reasons.

## The Brick Nation

The **Brick Nation** come in all sizes, from the toy-sized Minifigs and the even smaller Microfigs to the titanic Overfigs. Most of them may easily be recognized from their round, yellow heads and lack of fingers, but Brick Overlords have been known to maskerade as other species. They are a semi-mimetic artificial life-form apparently bent on taking over the Universe. Their mode of operation is generally peaceful: join a culture, then progressively replace its technology by brick-tech, then its main characters, and finally the world. While their efforts used to be limited in scope \(see the Brick City, the Boy Who Bricked and its Magic Brick School, the Block Knight of Brickham City, etc.\), they have recently completed their takeover of an entire galactic civilization \(Death Star Included\). Do not under estimate their smiling faces and open hands. Also, who is to say that they have not taken over one of the versions of the Bureaucracy yet?

## The Time Hierarchy

It is clear that the **Time Hierarchy** is somehow related to the Time Bureaucracy. Just as most branches of the Time Bureaucracy, the Time Hierarchy has a few agents that travel freely all over the Continuum, appearing and vanishing as they see fit, and somehow seem to be present around pretty much every critical juncture of history, past, present and future.

What is less clear is, well, pretty much everything else. Nobody seems to know from which time or place the Time Hierarchy originates or operates from, or what its agenda is. Its agents have been known to survive impossible wounds and diseases, as well as to outsmart highly-decorated Bureaucrats, which led to many conjectures, from a Post-Human origin to anthropomorphic robots or other kinds of artificial constructs.

Just as importantly, its agents are know to be arrogant pricks. Oh, and the lack of data on the Time Hierarchy has led most branches of the Time Bureaucracy to assume that agents of the Hierarchy have somehow managed to either infiltrate their ranks or break into their vaults, databanks and archives to erase any concrete information on the Hierarchy.

It is, of course, possible, that the Time Hierarchy is only a rumor. Or has been. Or will be.

## ...and more

The Universe is a large place, with plenty of space for more Cultures and Aliens. Do you wish to add Daleks, Harry Potter, the Spider Queen and Thanos? Sure, you can put them over there. But you can just as well come up with new, more exotic things of your own.

And, of course don't hesitate to use the Time Deck to improvise entire new civilizations, that's what it's here for!
