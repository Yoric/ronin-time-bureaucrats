# One and the Universe: Behind the scenes

## The Big Secret

Ok, so let's start with the big secret:

> There are no secrets.

Now that it's out of the box, let's elaborate. Ronin Time Bureaucrats is a game designed for narrative/improv role-playing. In narrative/improve role-playing games, the GM tends to rely a lot on the players to determine what is going on â€“ including what is going on behind the scenes.

Here are a few examples with seasoned players:

* GM: Rolls the dice. "Ok, Time Traveler Tina, the Ghost of Aid-El-Kebir Future turns his Longing Ray on you and you get 2 Damage."
* Tina's Player: Checking her character sheet, she determines that she can translate those 2 Damage into 2 Stress Points. In other words, no Consequence. "Luckily, I just had time to dodge. Without taking the time to catch my breath, I continue running towards the Ghost."
* GM: Rolls the dice. "Ok, Time Traveler Tim, the Ghost of Aid-El-Kebir Past turns his Nostalgia Ray on you and you... also get 2 Damage."
* Tim's Player: He can also translate those 2 Damage into 2 Stress Points. "Can this gun make me relive a happy moment of my past? Ok, then for a second, I'm dreaming of my 7th Birthday, that was my Best Birthday Ever. But I shrug it off. The Mission Comes First."
* \(later\)
* GM: "Tina, 3 more Damage for you."
* Tina's Player: Realizes that she needs to cross out a Minor Consequence. "I managed to dodge once again, but my backpack was caught in the blast and... well, I guess it just vanished into the Future. So I'm writing a Minor Consequence **All my equipment is gone**."
* GM: "Ok, you'll be able to replenish this easily once you can return to the Continuum Interaction."
* GM: "Tom, 3 more Damage for you, too."
* Tom's Player: Also needs to cross out a Minor Consequence. "I'm hit again."
*  In the meantime, tell me about something that you'll need very soon.

* Player: I open the door.
* GM: Has no clue
