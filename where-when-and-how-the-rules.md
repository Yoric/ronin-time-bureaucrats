# Where, When and How: The Rules

## Starting with Fate Core

Ok, time to confess it: Ronin Time Bureaucrats does not come with its own ruleset. There are so many good systems around, why invent a new one? So, rather than doing so, let's pick Fate Core, a simple ruleset designed to get out of the way and let us go on our merry adventures through Space·Time. We'll add the [Time Deck](/the-time-deck.md) and add some setting-specific flavour.

We're not going to copy the rules of Fate here, but:

* the rules are Pay-what-you-want, so you can simply [grab them at Evil Hat's \(https://www.evilhat.com/home/fate-core-downloads/\)](https://www.evilhat.com/home/fate-core-downloads/);
* the fine crew at Up To Four Players composed a great [two-pages webcomic introducing pretty much all the rules \(http://www.uptofourplayers.com/fate-core-rules/\)](http://www.uptofourplayers.com/fate-core-rules/);
* Geek & Sundry dedicated an awesome video session showing [how Fate plays \(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOFXtAHg7vU\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOFXtAHg7vU).

So, starting from this line, we're going to assume that you know the rules of Fate Core. If you don't, please hop into your Continuum Indirection and rewind Space·Time to read those rules!

## Health of The Continuum

The Continuum can be damaged by Observable Contradictions. For this reasons,

* The Continuum has its own Stress Track. Inducing Stress means that the Continuum has been lucky so far and not actually damaged. However, Stress may show up. A good example is pictures fading, books rewriting themselves, etc.

* The Continuum has its own Consequences Track \(Minor/Moderate/Major\). As for any character, Consequence damage does show up. Each Consequence is an Aspect that alters the Continuum and may be Compelled against any Time Traveler in the vicinity. You are encouraged to come up with possible stories that explain how things got that bad.

  * Examples of Minor Consequence:

    * The layout of Time Indirections has changed. You may have trouble finding things you have stashed, or using the new cockpit. Variants: the clothing of Time Travelers has changed.

    * Immunization shots are not so good anymore. You may find yourself getting sick from diseases to which you were previously immune.

  * Example of Moderate Consequence:

    * The Bureaucracy won't answer. It may have been erased, or maybe the communications technology just doesn't work so well anymore.
    * Random Time Travelers \(including you?\) have been erased from memories. Doing things is harder when people have trouble remembering that you exist.

  * Example of Major Consequence:

    * The Universe doesn't exist anymore. Expect any object within your reach to vanish at the worst possible time.

    * Time Travel has been erased. Expect your Time Indirection to stop working.

    * Mankind has been erased.

* These Tracks are shared by all Time Travellers present at a given Space·Time, whether PCs or NPCs.

* Observable Contradictions, no matter how much good will went into creating them, are an attack against the robustness of the Continuum, and may therefore cause damage \(Stress/Consequences\).

* The Continuum may be Taken Out, causing creation of a Pocket Continuum. That’s Bad. However, when the Continuum is Taken Out, any Stress and Consequences disappear immediately.

## Built-in Stunts

Every Time Traveler \(both PC and NPC\) gets the following Stunts for free:

* Because I can **Help Myself**, whenever I need to, I can spend 1 Fate Point to receive the help from my Future Self. My Future Self may do anything I would have done. If I am in presence of my Future Self for more than a brief instant, however, this causes damage equivalent to an Observable Contradiction.
* Because I'm a **Death-Defying Space·Time Traveler**, I can deflect any damage taken by myself to the Continuum.

## Explaining Away an Observable Contradiction

Recall how Time Traveler Tani and Time Traveler Tom were trying to Explain Away why killing Time Traveler Tom's Grandfather Gerry before he met Grandmother Gina wasn't such an Observable Contradiction?

The mechanism is called **Explaining Away** a Contradiction. It's how you defend the Continuum against whenever an Observable Contradiction attacks it. It's also, later, how you Bandage the Consequences of an Observable Contradiction.

All the players who wish to participate should offer a possible explanation and roll \(**what skill? To be determined**\) against a Good \(+3\) difficulty. The highest winner picks the story, establishing a temporary Fact, which may not be contradicted in this story.

1. All the players who wish to participate should offer the second part of the explanation and roll against the Success Level of the previous highest success. Highest winner picks the second part of the story, establishing a second Fact \(same rules\).

2. Continue until nobody wins and/or players run out of ideas.

Note:

* On a Tie, the Fact just established provides a Boost to the player for the rest of the Explanation

* On Success/Success with Style, this Fact provides Free Invocations which may be used either while coming up with the Explanation or later, when confronting this Explanation against the Paradox.

* If everybody fails, the players may wish to continue the Explanation may continue, in which case there will be a Free Invocation _against_ the Continuum.

* If your Fact may need the help of your Future Self, you may, as usual, pay one Fate Point to use your Aspect Time Traveler and get that help.

This establishes an **Explanation**.

Here, Time Traveler Tom and Time Traveler Tina established the following Explanation:

* Grandmother Greta was a drunk who had no clue who Time Traveler Tom’s grandfather really was.

* Someone took a picture of \(not-really-\) Grandfather Gerry and convinced Grandmother Greta that this was the real Grandfather – the roll wasn’t really good enough, but Time Traveler Tom is willing to spend one Fate Point to ensure that his Future Self will do it, so he got to reroll.

* Grandmother Greta always told Mother Maria that Grandfather Gerry was a violent man, so Mother Maria never attempted to get in touch with him.

Each Fact established during the Explanation serves as an Advantage \(with possibly Free Invocations – too late for Boosts\) to defend the Continuum. If it makes narrative sense, other characters may create further advantages to further help the Continuum. Roll an Attack as usual.

If the Attack fails, the Explanation becomes a permanent Aspect of these Space·Time coordinates. If the Attack succeeds, the Continuum was damaged, which may cause Consequences.
