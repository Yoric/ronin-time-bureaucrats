# Where, When and How: The Rules

## Starting with Fate Core

Ok, time to confess it: Ronin Time Bureaucrats does not come with its own ruleset. There are so many good systems around, why invent a new one? So, rather than doing so, let's pick Fate Core, a simple ruleset designed to get out of the way and let us go on our merry adventures through Space·Time. We'll add the [Time Deck](/the-time-deck.md) and just a little bit of Space·Time flavour.

We're not going to copy the rules of Fate here, but:

* the rules are Pay-what-you-want, starting at $0/0€, so you can simply [grab them at Evil Hat's \(https://www.evilhat.com/home/fate-core-downloads/\)](https://www.evilhat.com/home/fate-core-downloads/);
* the fine crew at Up To Four Players composed a great [two-pages webcomic introducing pretty much all the rules \(http://www.uptofourplayers.com/fate-core-rules/\)](http://www.uptofourplayers.com/fate-core-rules/);
* Geek & Sundry dedicated an awesome video session to showing [how Fate plays \(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOFXtAHg7vU\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOFXtAHg7vU).

So, starting from this line, we're going to assume that you know the rules of Fate Core. If you don't, please hop into your Continuum Indirection and rewind Space·Time to read those rules!

## Character Creation

Well, here you are, ready to create your very own Ronin Time Bureaucrat. It's a great day to be alive, isn't it?

So, the first thing you need to answer is: _just exactly who is your character_? The easiest is to start from an existing movie/novel/anime/comic book/... character and customize it from there. Some people start from musics, or from word associations. In Ronin Time Bureaucrats, pretty much anything does, so pick your poison.

In Ronin Time Bureaucrat, you can even use the Time Deck, so let's try that.

* _Who am I?_

![](/assets/reversed_small_even6.png)

I'm obviously some kind of rescuer.

* _Where do I come from?_

Mmmh... Lenin and Betrayal. I come from the Time Brigade. As a rescuer, I believed very strongly in my ideals, and in the necessity of freeing Space·Time from the shackles of Imperialist Capitalism. I believe that I was the youngest Political Officer of my promotion.

Apparently, I was betrayed. I wonder how I feel about it.

* _How do I feel about it?_

![](/assets/small_even10.png)

I'm Facing the Darkness. In other words, I'm continuing my fight without the Time Patrol.

This gives me enough for a High Concept: _You can bring me down, but you can't the people down!_

We now need a Trouble. It's probably going to be related both to my being a Wunderkind and to that betrayal.



This will become your High Concept. Examples of High Concepts:

* How did your character end up in a Continuum Indirection? Was your character a Bureaucrat who deserted, or did you join the Crew later? If your character was a Bureaucrat, in which branch?
* If your character deserted, why? If they joined a Crew, why?

## Continuum Creation

## Amendments to Fate Core

### Health

In Space·Time, most threats are deadly. Unless they have specialized Stunts, characters only have one Consequence slot.

That's easy to remember, there's only one slot in your character sheet.

### Available Skills

The list of skills is slightly shorter than that of Fate Core.

* Awareness
  * Noticing things. Also, 6th sense.
* Consensus
  * Everything related to building consensus without threats. Dealing peacefully with crowds or individuals.
* Empathy

  * Everything related to understanding people and emotional clues. Also, making people better, emotionally.

* Expertise

  * Anything that you spent long time studying to learn and that is not covered by other Skills. Exactly what depends on your Aspects. If you're a Historian, this will cover your History. If you're a Kung-Fu Monk, this will probably cover both Zen and the Precepts of your Order.

* Fight

  * Close-combat fighting, whether armed or unarmed. Used both for attacking and for defending.

* Fortitude

  * Standing hardships. Also, pure physical feats, such as carrying something heavy.

* Healing

  * Making people better, through physical treatment or chemistry. Also, making people worse, through physical treatment or chemistry. Your call.

* Investigate

  * Everything related to understanding scenes or physical clues.

* Mobility

  * Everything related to moving around. Typically, running either towards danger or away from it, including running for cover when someone is shooting at you. Once you know how to use a vehicle, or a horse, or anything that can get you somewhere, that's how you use it. Also good for guerrilla warfare.

* Spelunking

  * Everything related to exploring a place. Doesn't have to be scary, dark, underground and filled with awful noises, but then again, it can.

* Shoot

  * Distance fighting, typically armed, from throwing shurikens to sniping to adjusting battle-canons. Used for attacking, providing cover fire, shooting down the lights, throwing baseballs, etc.

* Stealth

  * Doing things without people noticing, including their pockets. May be used for disguises.

* Tactics

  * Planning things ahead for you and other people. Often used to create advantages before or during confrontations.

* Theatrics

  * Attracting attention, impressing people, also scaring or provoking people, or resisting Empathy. May be used for disguises.

* Tinkering

  * Making things work. Making things stop to work, too, if you prefer. That's also how you learn to use any kind of apparatus, including vehicles, including animals.

* Will

  * Resisting attempts to convince, trick or brainwash you. Also, bravery.

During character creation, pick:

* one skill at which your character is Great \(+4\)
* two skills at which your character is Good \(+3\)
* three skills at which your character is Fair \(+2\)
* four skills at which your character is Average \(+1\)
* everything else is +0

### Health of The Continuum

The Continuum get its own character sheet, oh joy! That's largely because the Continuum can be damaged by Observable Contradictions.

* The Continuum has its own Stress Track. Inducing Stress means that the Continuum has been lucky so far and not actually damaged. If you wish, Stress may show up, as minor manifestations: pictures fading, books rewriting themselves, etc.

* The Continuum has its own Consequences Track \(Minor/Moderate/Major\). As for any character, Consequence damage does show up. Each Consequence is an Aspect that alters the Continuum and may be Compelled against any Time Traveler in the vicinity. You are encouraged to come up with possible stories that explain how things got that bad.

  * Examples of Minor Consequence:

    * _The layout of Time Indirections has changed_. You may have trouble finding things you have stashed, or using the new cockpit. Variants: the clothing of Time Travelers has changed, making it harder for them to walk, or run, or find stuff in their pockets.

    * _Immunization shots are not so good anymore_. You may find yourself getting sick from diseases to which you were previously immune.

  * Example of Moderate Consequence:

    * _The Bureaucracy won't answer_. It may have been erased, or maybe the communications technology just doesn't work so well anymore.
    * _Random Time Travelers have been erased from memories_. Doing things is harder when people have trouble remembering that you exist.

  * Example of Major Consequence:

    * _The Universe doesn't exist anymore_. Expect any object within your reach to vanish at the worst possible time.

    * _Time Travel has been erased_. Expect the GM to compel your Continuum Indirection to stop working now and then.

    * _Mankind has been erased_. Expect people around you to vanish mid-sentence. Possibly including you, temporarily.

* These Tracks are shared by all Time Travellers present at a given Space·Time, whether PCs or NPCs. Consequently, NPCs may be busy both damaging the Continuum and Bandaging it. In fact, attempting to prevent or bandage damage to the Continuum is one of the rare occasions during which pretty much all Time Travelers will show a somewhat united front and suspend backstabbing long enough to avoid Something Very Bad.

* Observable Contradictions, no matter how much good will went into creating them, are an attack against the robustness of the Continuum, and may therefore cause damage \(Stress/Consequences\).

* If the Continuum is Taken Out, that's a Snafu. That's Really, Really Bad. I personally have no clue what's going to happen, but you're welcome to come up with ideas! Also, please hurt the characters – nobody should want another Snafu. Well, nobody except the 0.001%, or that Mad Scientist over there, and perhaps a few Most Benevolent Administrators, oh, and possibly some members of the Time Hierarchy, or some extremists from the Time Purity Patrols, or... Oh, well, it's lucky you're here to fight them.

* The Continuum may Concede at any time. This creates an implosive Pocket Continuum, trapping any Time Traveler in the vicinity. That's Bad. On the upside, Stress disappears immediately and Consequences are limited to the Pocket Continuum.

#### Recovery

The Continuum recovers Stress whenever there is a downtime. Just like that. The downside is that, once there is any Consequence beyond Minor, it's unlikely that you're going to have any kind of downtime. Chances are that you need to Fix Things Now, before they get any worse.

The easiest way to fix Consequences to the Continuum is actually to let it Concede. It's Bad, and quite possibly deadly for the Crew, but it's not as Bad as a Snafu.

Alternatively, you can work to Fix the Continuum. Continuum Consequences need to be Bandaged before they can recover. Bandaging a Continuum Consequence requires coming up with an **Explanation** of why the Consequence is now Bandaged, from the safety of the Continuum Indirection \(see below\). Once a Consequence is Bandaged, things get better, but the Consequence is not fully healed. Full healing may take time.

* Minor Consequences heal pretty much immediately once they have been Bandaged.

* Example of a Bandaged Moderate Consequence:

  * _The Bureaucracy won't answer_ becomes _Trouble on the waves_ or _Bureaucracy offices are closed for repairs_. The Bureaucracy is still there, but getting a call through won't be easy.

  * _Random Time Travelers have been erased from memories_ becomes _Passing for a Time Traveler has become easy_. People now remember forgetting Time Travelers and branches of the Bureaucracy are taking advantage to infiltrate each other.

* Example of a Bandaged Major Consequence:

  * _The Universe doesn't exist anymore_ becomes _Universe under reconstruction_. Pieces of the Continuum are missing, but Crews of Time Bureaucrats are bringing them back one by one. Or fighting over them.
  * _Time Travel has been erased_ becomes _Time Travel is coming back_. Most Continuum Indirections are down, possibly including yours. You may have to find a new one before you can do anything with it.
  * _Mankind has been erased_ becomes _Another life-form rules_. Mankind is coming back, one piece of Space·Time at a time. The Time Bureaucracy may even still exist. However, it is now ruled by White Mice from the 15th Dimension.

Once a Consequence is Bandaged, the Continuum may take a second Consequence of the same level without being Taken Out. Oh, more joy.

FIXME: How fast does the Continuum recover?

### Setting Aspects

The following Aspects come with the Setting. They may be invoked and compelled as any other Aspect.

* **The Continuum is Fragile**. Examples of compels:
  * Call for a truce between branches of the Bureaucracy, long enough to Explain away an Observable Contradiction or a Consequence.
  * Get a damaged Continuum to Concede, creating an implosive Pocket Continuum.
  * Convince Time Travelers to please not shoot.

### Built-in Stunts

Every Time Traveler \(both PC and NPC\) gets the following Stunts for free:

* Because I can **Help Myself**, whenever I need to, I can spend 1 Fate Point to receive the help from my Future Self. My Future Self may do anything I would have done. If I am in presence of my Future Self for more than a brief instant, however, it becomes pretty much impossible to actually remember exactly how my Future Self behaved to be able to imitate them, so expect Observable Contradictions.
* Because I'm a **Death-Defying Space·Time Traveler**, I can deflect any damage taken by myself to the Continuum. Given how fragile the Continuum is, it is generally a good idea to Concede the conflict after this.

### Examples of Space·Time traveler Stunts

As usual with Fate, the best way to create a character is _not_ to pick Stunts from a list, but rather to design the Stunt for that character. That being said, here's a list of stunts that can serve as sources of inspiration.

Stunts are there to differentiate characters. Consequently, two members of the same Crew **should not have the same Stunt** \(other than the built-in Stunts above\).

* Because I'm a **Living Encyclopedia of Space·Time**, I have a +2 to remember historical and geographical facts about this place/period.

* Because I’m **Good at Space·Time Orientation**, I have a +2 to determine where and when I am.

* Because I'm a **Space·Time Communication Specialist**, if I have access to communication material, I have a +2 to hack it into something that will let me communicate with any specific person through Space·Time.

* Because I live a **Split Second Ahead**, whenever I use a Fate Point to reroll an action that lasted only a split second \(such as dodging\), I can also decide to change the nature of my action.

* Because I’m a **Space·Time Surgeon**, I get +2 when rolling to fix the Continuum from the safety of my Time Machine.

* Because I’m good with **Old Junk**, I get +2 when attempting to build or fix modern tech using old parts.

* Because I know how to **Place Messages in a Bottle**, I get +2 when attempting to send a message to the future without any kind of technology.

* I know how to place **Space·Time Ambushes**, which gives me +2 to setup ambushes against Time Travelers.

* Because I tend to **Fit right in**, I get +2 to look and sound like an inhabitant of this Space·Time.

* Because **People pay attention** when I talk to them, whenever I'm discussing with someone, I get +2 to draw their attention towards me – and away from anything else.

* Because **I talk fast**, if I have spotted an enemy about to attack me, I always have time to try and strike a conversation before the combat starts. Of course, this doesn't work as well if I do not have a way to communicate with the enemy.

* Because **The better part of valor is survival**, if I have spotted an enemy about to attack me, I always have an opportunity to run away before the combat starts. Of course, this doesn't work as well if I'm trapped.

### Explaining Away an Observable Contradiction

Recall how Time Traveler Tani and Time Traveler Tom were trying to Explain Away why killing Time Traveler Tom's Grandfather Gerry before he met Grandmother Gina wasn't such an Observable Contradiction?

The mechanism is called **Explaining Away** a Contradiction. It's how you defend the Continuum against whenever an Observable Contradiction attacks it. It's also, later, how you Bandage the Consequences of an Observable Contradiction.

All the players who wish to participate should offer a possible explanation and roll the relevant skill against a Good \(+3\) difficulty. The highest winner picks the story, establishing a temporary Fact, which may not be contradicted in this story.

1. All the players who wish to participate should offer the second part of the explanation and roll against the Success Level of the previous highest success. Highest winner picks the second part of the story, establishing a second Fact \(same rules\).

2. Continue until nobody wins and/or players run out of ideas.

Note:

* Let the player pick the relevant skill to roll. For instance, one may argue that either Awareness, Empathy, Theatrics or Tactics may give them an intuition of what other people will do, Awareness, Investigate or Tinkering may give them an intuition of how technology will evolve, etc.

* On a Tie, the Fact just established provides a Boost to the player for the rest of the Explanation

* On Success/Success with Style, this Fact provides Free Invocations which may be used either while coming up with the Explanation or later, when confronting this Explanation against the Paradox.

* If everybody fails, the players may wish to continue the Explanation may continue, in which case there will be a Free Invocation _against_ the Continuum.

* If your Fact may need the help of your Future Self, you may, as usual, use **Help Myself** and pay one Fate Point to use your Aspect Time Traveler and get that help.

This establishes an **Explanation**.

Here, Time Traveler Tom and Time Traveler Tina established the following Explanation:

* Grandmother Greta was a drunk who had no clue who Time Traveler Tom’s grandfather really was.

* Someone took a picture of \(not-really-\) Grandfather Gerry and convinced Grandmother Greta that this was the real Grandfather – the roll wasn’t really good enough, but Time Traveler Tom is willing to spend one Fate Point to ensure that his Future Self will do it, so he got to reroll.

* Grandmother Greta always told Mother Maria that Grandfather Gerry was a violent man, so Mother Maria never attempted to get in touch with him.

When the Continuum is being damaged by an Observable Contradiction, each Fact established during the Explanation serves as an Advantage \(with possibly Free Invocations – too late for Boosts\) to defend the Continuum. If it makes narrative sense, other characters may create further advantages to further help the Continuum. Roll an Attack and determine damage as usual.

When Consequences to the Continuum are being Bandaged, each Fact established during the Explanation serves as an Advantage \(with possibly Free Invocations – too late for Boosts\) to fix the Continuum. If it makes narrative sense, other characters may create further advantages to further help the Continuum. Roll against Fair \(+2\) difficulty to Bandage a Minor Consequence, Great \(+4\) difficulty to Bandage a Great Consequence, Fantastic \(+6\) difficulty to Bandage a Major Consequence.

If the Explanation succeeded at deflecting the Attack/Bandaging the Consequence, the Explanation becomes a permanent Aspect of this Continuum. Don't forget to write it down on the Continuum's Character Sheet.

### Experience & Plunder

At the end of every adventure, characters carry away one **Experience & Plunder**. This Experience & Plunder may be an object, a lesson learned, a skill mastered, a contact, a memory, ... The player gets to decide exactly what the Experience actually is and writes it down on the character sheet.

Each Experience is a new Aspect for the character. Experiences may be invoked for free _once per adventure_, or for one Fate Point as other Aspects.

## And more

### Non-Player Characters

Most Non-Player Characters are described by:

* a few Aspects, which work exactly like the Aspects of the Player Characters;
* a few Good At, for which they roll with +2;
* a few Poor At, for which they roll with -2;
* a Durability, which measure how much Stress they may take before breaking \(which doesn't mean dying, mind you\).

Whenever there are at least two NPCs opposing the PCs, there are at least two ways to play the NPCs. They can be a **Passerbys** or a **Team**. Passerbys act independently from each other. For instance, in a combat situation, typically, each of them will attack one PC. By opposition, Teams work together. For instance, in a combat situation, the strongest will attack one of the PCs, while the others will run interference, Creating Advantages for their vanguard, until that one may strike at the PC.

With the exact same group of NPCs, you will notice that Teams are much better at actually hurting the PCs than Passerbys. Deciding whether they do this is up to the GM.
