# Where, When and How: The Rules

## Starting with Fate Core

Ok, time to confess it: Ronin Time Bureaucrats does not come with its own ruleset. There are so many good systems around, why invent a new one? So, rather than doing so, let's pick Fate Core, a simple ruleset designed to get out of the way and let us go on our merry adventures through Space·Time. We'll add the [Time Deck](/the-time-deck.md) and add some setting-specific flavour.

We're not going to copy the rules of Fate here, but:

* the rules are Pay-what-you-want, so you can simply [grab them at Evil Hat's \(https://www.evilhat.com/home/fate-core-downloads/\)](https://www.evilhat.com/home/fate-core-downloads/);
* the fine crew at Up To Four Players composed a great [two-pages webcomic introducing pretty much all the rules \(http://www.uptofourplayers.com/fate-core-rules/\)](http://www.uptofourplayers.com/fate-core-rules/);
* Geek & Sundry dedicated an awesome video session showing [how Fate plays \(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOFXtAHg7vU\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOFXtAHg7vU).

So, starting from this line, we're going to assume that you know the rules of Fate Core. If you don't, please hop into your Continuum Indirection and rewind Space·Time to read those rules!

## Available Skills

* Awareness
  * Noticing things. Also, 6th sense.
* Consensus
  * Everything related to building consensus without threats. Dealing peacefully with crowds or individuals.
* Empathy

  * Everything related to understanding people and emotional clues. Also, making people better, emotionally.

* Expertise

  * Anything that you spent long time studying to learn and that is not covered by other Skills. Exactly what depends on your Aspects. If you're a Historian, this will cover your History. If you're a Kung-Fu Monk, this will probably cover both Zen and the Precepts of your Order.

* Healing

  * Making people better, physically. Also, poisoning.

* Fight

  * Close-combat fighting, whether armed or unarmed.

* Fortitude

  * Standing hardships. Also, pure physical feats, such as carrying something heavy.

* Investigate

  * Everything related to understanding scenes or physical clues.

* Mobility

  * Everything related to moving around. Typically, running either towards danger or away from it. Also good for guerrilla warfare.

* Spelunking

  * Everything related to exploring a place. Doesn't have to be scary, dark, underground and filled with awful noises, but then again, it can.

* Shoot

  * Distance fighting, typically armed, from throwing shurikens to sniping to adjusting battle-canons.

* Stealth

  * Doing things without people noticing, including their pockets. May be used for disguises.

* Tactics

  * Planning things ahead for you and other people.

* Theatrics

  * Attracting attention, impressing people, also scaring or provoking people, or resisting Empathy. May be used for disguises.

* Tinkering

  * Making things work. Making things stop to work, too, if you prefer.

* Will

  * Resisting attempts to convince, trick or brainwash you. Also, bravery.

During character creation, pick:

* one skill at which your character is Great \(+4\)
* two skills at which your character is Good \(+3\)
* three skills at which your character is Fair \(+2\)
* four skills at which your character is Average \(+1\)
* everything else is +0

## Health of The Continuum

The Continuum can be damaged by Observable Contradictions. For this reasons,

* The Continuum has its own Stress Track. Inducing Stress means that the Continuum has been lucky so far and not actually damaged. However, Stress may show up. A good example is pictures fading, books rewriting themselves, etc.

* The Continuum has its own Consequences Track \(Minor/Moderate/Major\). As for any character, Consequence damage does show up. Each Consequence is an Aspect that alters the Continuum and may be Compelled against any Time Traveler in the vicinity. You are encouraged to come up with possible stories that explain how things got that bad.

  * Examples of Minor Consequence:

    * The layout of Time Indirections has changed. You may have trouble finding things you have stashed, or using the new cockpit. Variants: the clothing of Time Travelers has changed.

    * Immunization shots are not so good anymore. You may find yourself getting sick from diseases to which you were previously immune.

  * Example of Moderate Consequence:

    * The Bureaucracy won't answer. It may have been erased, or maybe the communications technology just doesn't work so well anymore.
    * Random Time Travelers \(including you?\) have been erased from memories. Doing things is harder when people have trouble remembering that you exist.

  * Example of Major Consequence:

    * The Universe doesn't exist anymore. Expect any object within your reach to vanish at the worst possible time.

    * Time Travel has been erased. Expect your Time Indirection to stop working.

    * Mankind has been erased.

* These Tracks are shared by all Time Travellers present at a given Space·Time, whether PCs or NPCs.

* Observable Contradictions, no matter how much good will went into creating them, are an attack against the robustness of the Continuum, and may therefore cause damage \(Stress/Consequences\).

* The Continuum may be Taken Out, causing creation of a Pocket Continuum. That’s Bad. However, when the Continuum is Taken Out, any Stress and Consequences disappear immediately.

## Built-in Stunts

Every Time Traveler \(both PC and NPC\) gets the following Stunts for free:

* Because I can **Help Myself**, whenever I need to, I can spend 1 Fate Point to receive the help from my Future Self. My Future Self may do anything I would have done. If I am in presence of my Future Self for more than a brief instant, however, this causes damage equivalent to an Observable Contradiction.
* Because I'm a **Death-Defying Space·Time Traveler**, I can deflect any damage taken by myself to the Continuum.

## Additional Stunts

As usual with Fate, the best way to create a character is _not_ to pick Stunts from a list, but rather to design the Stunt for that character. That being said, here's a list of stunts that can serve as sources of inspiration.

* Because I'm a **Living Encyclopedia of Space·Time**, I have a +2 to remember historical and geographical facts about this place/period.

* Because I’m **Good at Space·Time Orientation**, I have a +2 to determine where and when I am.

* Because I'm a **Space·Time Communication Specialist**, if I have access to communication material, I have a +2 to hack it into something that will let me communicate with any specific person through Space·Time.

* Because I live a **Split Second Ahead**, whenever I use a Fate Point to reroll an action that lasted only a split second \(such as dodging\), I can also decide to change the nature of my action.

* Because I’m a **Space·Time Surgeon**, I get +2 when rolling to fix the Continuum from the safety of my Time Machine.

* Because I’m good with **Old Junk**, I get +2 when attempting to build or fix modern tech using old parts.

* Because I know how to **Place Messages in a Bottle**, I get +2 when attempting to send a message to the future without any kind of technology.

* I know how to place **Space·Time Ambushes**, which gives me +2 to setup ambushes against Time Travelers.

* Because I tend to **Fit right in**, I get +2 to look and sound like an inhabitant of this Space·Time.

* Because **People pay attention** when I talk to them, whenever I'm discussing with someone, I get +2 to draw their attention towards me – and away from anything else.

* Because **I talk fast**, if I have spotted an enemy about to attack me, I always have time to try and strike a conversation before the combat starts. Of course, this doesn't work as well if I do not have a way to communicate with the enemy.

* Because **The better part of valor is survival**, if I have spotted an enemy about to attack me, I always have an opportunity to run away before the combat starts. Of course, this doesn't work as well if I'm trapped.

## Explaining Away an Observable Contradiction

Recall how Time Traveler Tani and Time Traveler Tom were trying to Explain Away why killing Time Traveler Tom's Grandfather Gerry before he met Grandmother Gina wasn't such an Observable Contradiction?

The mechanism is called **Explaining Away** a Contradiction. It's how you defend the Continuum against whenever an Observable Contradiction attacks it. It's also, later, how you Bandage the Consequences of an Observable Contradiction.

All the players who wish to participate should offer a possible explanation and roll \(**what skill? To be determined**\) against a Good \(+3\) difficulty. The highest winner picks the story, establishing a temporary Fact, which may not be contradicted in this story.

1. All the players who wish to participate should offer the second part of the explanation and roll against the Success Level of the previous highest success. Highest winner picks the second part of the story, establishing a second Fact \(same rules\).

2. Continue until nobody wins and/or players run out of ideas.

Note:

* On a Tie, the Fact just established provides a Boost to the player for the rest of the Explanation

* On Success/Success with Style, this Fact provides Free Invocations which may be used either while coming up with the Explanation or later, when confronting this Explanation against the Paradox.

* If everybody fails, the players may wish to continue the Explanation may continue, in which case there will be a Free Invocation _against_ the Continuum.

* If your Fact may need the help of your Future Self, you may, as usual, pay one Fate Point to use your Aspect Time Traveler and get that help.

This establishes an **Explanation**.

Here, Time Traveler Tom and Time Traveler Tina established the following Explanation:

* Grandmother Greta was a drunk who had no clue who Time Traveler Tom’s grandfather really was.

* Someone took a picture of \(not-really-\) Grandfather Gerry and convinced Grandmother Greta that this was the real Grandfather – the roll wasn’t really good enough, but Time Traveler Tom is willing to spend one Fate Point to ensure that his Future Self will do it, so he got to reroll.

* Grandmother Greta always told Mother Maria that Grandfather Gerry was a violent man, so Mother Maria never attempted to get in touch with him.

Each Fact established during the Explanation serves as an Advantage \(with possibly Free Invocations – too late for Boosts\) to defend the Continuum. If it makes narrative sense, other characters may create further advantages to further help the Continuum. Roll an Attack as usual.

If the Attack fails, the Explanation becomes a permanent Aspect of these Space·Time coordinates. If the Attack succeeds, the Continuum was damaged, which may cause Consequences.

## Experience

At the end of every adventure, characters carry away one **Experience**. This Experience may be an object, a lesson learned, a skill mastered, a contact, a memory, ... The player gets to decide exactly what the Experience actually is.

Write down the Experience on the character sheet.

Each Experience is a new Aspect for the character. Experiences may be invoked for free _once per adventure_, or for one Fate Point as other Aspects.

## Non-Player Characters

Most Non-Player Characters are described by:

* a few Aspects, which work exactly like the Aspects of the Player Characters;
* a few Good At, for which they roll with +2;
* a few Poor At, for which they roll with -2;
* a Durability, which measure how much Stress they may take before breaking \(which doesn't mean dying, mind you\).

Whenever there are at least two NPCs opposing the PCs, there are at least two ways to play the NPCs. They can be a **Passerbys** or a **Team**. Passerbys act independently from each other. For instance, in a combat situation, typically, each of them will attack one PC. By opposition, Teams work together. For instance, in a combat situation, the strongest will attack one of the PCs, while the others will run interference, Creating Advantages for their vanguard, until that one may strike at the PC.

With the exact same group of NPCs, you will notice that Teams are much better at actually hurting the PCs than Passerbys. Deciding whether they do this is up to the GM.
