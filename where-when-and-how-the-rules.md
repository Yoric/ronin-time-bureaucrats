# Where, When and How: The Rules

## Starting with Fate Core

Ok, time to confess it: Ronin Time Bureaucrats does not come with its own ruleset.

| ![](/assets/Rules.png) |
| :---: |


There are so many good systems around, why invent a new one? So, rather than doing so, let's pick Fate Core, a simple ruleset designed to get out of the way and let us improv our merry adventures through Space·Time. We'll add the [Time Deck](/the-time-deck.md) and just a little bit of Space·Time flavour.

To introduce us to Fate Core, we have invited Janus, God of Portals.



We're not going to copy the rules of Fate Core here, but:

* the rules are Pay-what-you-want, starting at $0/0€, so you can simply [grab them at Evil Hat's \(https://www.evilhat.com/home/fate-core-downloads/\)](https://www.evilhat.com/home/fate-core-downloads/);
* the fine crew at Up To Four Players composed a great [two-pages webcomic introducing pretty much all the rules \(http://www.uptofourplayers.com/fate-core-rules/\)](http://www.uptofourplayers.com/fate-core-rules/);
* Geek & Sundry dedicated an awesome video session to showing [how Fate plays \(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOFXtAHg7vU\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOFXtAHg7vU).

So, starting from this line, we're going to assume that you know the rules of Fate Core. If you don't, please hop into your Continuum Indirection and rewind Space·Time to read those rules! The rest of this chapter is mostly examples of how these rules apply to Space·Time. The only really new rule is that of **Explanations**.

As usual with Ronin Time Bureaucrats, if you disagree with these rules, don't hesitate to come up with your own – or to wing it!

## Creating a Character

Well, here you are, ready to create your very own Ronin Time Bureaucrat. It's a great day to be alive, isn't it?

You'll need the Character Sheet at the end of this chapter.

### High Concept and Trouble

So, the first thing you need to answer is: _just exactly who is your character_? Some people prefer starting from an existing movie/novel/anime/comic book/... character and customize it from there. Some people start from musics, or from word associations. In Ronin Time Bureaucrats, pretty much anything does, so pick your poison.

If you feel like it, you can even use the Time Deck. Let's try that!

* _Who am I?_

![](/assets/reversed_small_even6.png)

I'm obviously some kind of rescuer, or at least, I feel like one.

* _Where do I come from?_

![](/assets/reversed_small_even3.png)

Mmmh... Lenin and Betrayal. I obviously come from the Time Brigade. As a rescuer, I believe very strongly in my ideals, and in the necessity of freeing Space·Time from the shackles of Imperialist Capitalism. Maybe I was the youngest Political Officer of my promotion.

Apparently, I was betrayed. I wonder how I feel about it.

* _How do I feel about it?_

![](/assets/small_even10.png)

I'm Facing the Darkness. In other words, I'm continuing my fight without the Time Brigade.

Wait a second, a True Believer, Facing the Darkness in the Time Brigade and Betrayed? I'm obviously Space·Time Trotsky!

This gives me enough for a High Concept: _**Space·Time Guerrilla Trotsky**_. I'll need to discuss this with the GM, but I believe that I should be able to invoke that aspect both to come up with economic theories, write and deliver speeches, and locate supporters. On the other hand, I am probably feared and distrusted by most branches of the Bureaucracy and hunted down by local authorities, which makes it a good compel.

I wonder if the other players would go along as my followers or bodyguards. Otherwise, I'm just hiding among them, bidding my time.

As a Space·Time Guerrilla Trotsky, I should probably pick a matching name. Maybe I'll pick in history Lev Davidovitch, or in literature Emmanuel Goldstein, or Snowball.

I'm also on track for a Trouble: obviously, Space·Time Stalin is after me. Let's refine this.

* _What does Space·Time Stalin want to do to me_?

![](/assets/reversed_small_even1.png)

Innocence? Well, that sounds like brainwashing! Mmmh... I could say that the Time Brigade is after me to brainwash me, but that sounds a bit redundant. Maybe they have already brainwashed me and it didn't stick? That should be more interesting!

So here's my Trouble: _**My brainwashing didn't stick. Now, Time Brigade wants to finish the job**_.

### Other Aspects

Typically, I'll need:

* One Aspect to determine how I joined \(or recruited\) the Crew. This will have to come up during conversation with other Players. For the moment, it's sufficient to determine whether I joined or recruited the Crew.
* Two Aspects showcasing adventures I've had with Crew members. Again, this will have to come up during conversation with other Players. Also, I don't feel like coming up with these Aspects right now, I'd prefer adding them while playing.

So, we're done for Aspects for the time being.

### Skills

The list of skills is slightly shorter than that of Fate Core:

* Awareness
  * Noticing things. Also, 6th sense.
* Consensus
  * Everything related to building consensus without threats. Dealing peacefully with crowds or individuals.
* Empathy

  * Everything related to understanding people and emotional clues. Also, making people better, emotionally.

* Expertise

  * Anything that you spent long time studying to learn and that is not covered by other Skills. Exactly what depends on your Aspects. If you're a Historian, this will cover your History. If you're a Kung-Fu Monk, this will probably cover both Zen and the Precepts of your Order.

* Fight

  * Close-combat fighting, whether armed or unarmed. Used both for attacking and for defending.

* Fortitude

  * Standing hardships. Also, pure physical feats, such as carrying something heavy.

* Healing

  * Making people better, through physical treatment or chemistry. Also, making people worse, through physical treatment or chemistry. Your call.

* Investigate

  * Everything related to understanding scenes or physical clues.

* Mobility

  * Everything related to moving around. Typically, running either towards danger or away from it, including running for cover when someone is shooting at you. Once you know how to use a vehicle, or a horse, or anything that can get you somewhere, that's how you use it. Also good for guerrilla warfare.

* Spelunking

  * Everything related to exploring a place. Doesn't have to be scary, dark, underground and filled with awful noises, but then again, it can.

* Shoot

  * Distance fighting, typically armed, from throwing shurikens to sniping to adjusting battle-canons. Used for attacking, providing cover fire, shooting down the lights, throwing baseballs, etc.

* Stealth

  * Doing things without people noticing, including their pockets. May be used for disguises.

* Tactics

  * Planning things ahead for you and other people. Often used to create advantages before or during confrontations.

* Theatrics

  * Attracting attention, impressing people, also scaring or provoking people, or resisting Empathy. May be used for disguises.

* Tinkering

  * Making things work. Making things stop to work, too, if you prefer. That's also how you learn to use any kind of apparatus, including vehicles, including animals.

* Will

  * Resisting attempts to convince, trick or brainwash you. Also, bravery.

You can find this list copied on the Continuum Sheet and the Indirection Sheet.

A starting character gets:

* one Skill at which your character is Great \(+4\);
* two Skills at which your character is Good \(+3\);
* three Skills at which your character is Fair \(+2\);
* four Skills at which your character is Average \(+1\);
* everything else is +0

As with Aspects, not all Skills need to be picked up during character creation.

For Space·Time Guerrilla Trotsky, I will pick:

* A Great Will, because nothing can get him to change his mind about Imperialist Capitalism or the Shadow that took over the Time Brigade. Also, it will make it harder for Space·Time Stalin to brainwash me. Take that, Space·Time Stalin!
* Good Mobility, because I've been on the run for a few subjective years already.
* Good Tactics, because I need to stay one step ahead of the Time Brigade. Also, with Mobility + Tactics, I'm starting to be pretty good at Guerrilla Warfare.
* Fair Stealth, because that's also going to be necessary for my Space·Time Guerrilla.
* Fair Expertise, which my Space·Time Guerrilla Trotsky Aspect will let me use apply to historico-economic marxist theories. It's not Great, but I can always invoke my Aspect to boost me.

I'll leave everything else to be decided during gameplay. I feel like I have followers, and I feel like I need a Stunt to be a good orator.

### Free Stunts

Every Time Traveler \(both PC and NPC\) gets the following Stunts for free:

* Because I can **Help Myself**, whenever I need to, I can spend 1 Fate Point to receive the help from my Future Self. My Future Self may do anything I would have done. If I am in presence of my Future Self for more than a brief instant, however, it becomes pretty much impossible to actually remember exactly how my Future Self behaved to be able to imitate them, so expect Observable Contradictions.
* Because I'm a **Death-Defying Space·Time Traveler**, I can deflect any damage taken by myself to the Continuum. Given how fragile the Continuum is, it is generally a good idea to Concede the conflict after this.

These stunts are copied on the Continuum Sheet. You don't need to write them down.

### Coming up with Space·Time Stunts

Each character may start with up to three Stunts.

Stunts generally look like:

* Because I am/I know/I have \(something\), I get a +2 to \(do something\) whenever \(some condition is met\).
* Because I am/I know/I have \(something\), I can use \(some Skill\) to \(do something\) instead of using \(some Skill\) whenever \(some condition is met\).
* Because I am/I know/I have \(something\), once per scene where \(some condition is met\), I can spend one Fate Point to \(do something cool and otherwise impossible\).

Stunts are there to differentiate characters. Consequently, two members of the same Crew **should not have the same Stunt** \(other than the built-in Stunts above\).

As usual with Fate, the best way to create a character is _not_ to pick Stunts from a list, but rather to design the Stunt for that character. That being said, here's a list of stunts that can serve as sources of inspiration:

* Because I'm a **Living Encyclopedia of Space·Time**, I have a +2 to remember historical and geographical facts about this place/period.

* Because I’m **Good at Space·Time Orientation**, I have a +2 to determine where and when I am.

* Because I'm a **Space·Time Communication Specialist**, if I have access to communication material, I have a +2 to hack it into something that will let me communicate with any specific person through Space·Time.

* Because I live a **Split Second Ahead**, whenever I use a Fate Point to reroll an action that lasted only a split second \(such as dodging\), I can also decide to change the nature of my action.

* Because I’m a **Space·Time Surgeon**, I get +2 when rolling to fix the Continuum from the safety of my Time Machine.

* Because I’m good with **Old Junk**, I get +2 when attempting to build or fix modern tech using old parts.

* Because I know how to **Place Messages in a Bottle**, I get +2 when attempting to send a message to the future without any kind of technology.

* I know how to place **Space·Time Ambushes**, which gives me +2 to setup ambushes against Time Travelers.

* Because I tend to **Fit right in**, I get +2 to look and sound like an inhabitant of this Space·Time.

* Because **People pay attention** when I talk to them, whenever I'm discussing with someone, I get +2 to draw their attention towards me – and away from anything else.

* Because **I talk fast**, if I have spotted an enemy about to attack me, I always have time to try and strike a conversation before the combat starts. Of course, this doesn't work as well if I do not have a way to communicate with the enemy.

* Because **The better part of valor is survival**, if I have spotted an enemy about to attack me, I always have an opportunity to run away before the combat starts. Of course, this doesn't work as well if I'm trapped.

Well, none of these seems particularly suited to Space·Time Trotsky. Let's see if I can come up with something better:

* "_Because I am a **Passionate Orator**, whenever I deliver a speech on something that truly matters to me and that I truly, deeply, believe, I can use Will instead of Consensus to convince the crowd_."
* _"Because I have **Guerilleros Everywhere**, I can use Tactics to Create an Advantage **Local Guerrilla Cell** in any city or settlement with oppressed workers. This works only once per city/settlement per scenario."_

My Space·Time Trotsky is now a force to be reckoned with. I will leave the last Stunt to be decided during play.

### Health

Each character has one Physical Stress track that represent near-misses or wounds that may simply be shrugged away in physical conflicts and one Mental Stress track that represent near-misses or attacks that may simply be shrugged away in a conflict of wills and wits. By default, each character gets three Physical Stress and three Mental Stress boxes that may be ticked to avoid being Taken Out by an attack. Some Stunts may add a fourth box.

When the Stress boxes are not sufficient, characters may take a Consequence to avoid being Taken Out by an attack.

Recall that a player may decide to Concede at any time and decide what happens to their character. That's _way_ better than being Taken Out!

### Fate Refresh

You start with a Fate Refresh of 3. That's how many Fate Points you can put on your character sheet at the start of every session. So, just write 3. You can increase it later.

### ...and almost ready

Space·Time Trotsky is basically ready.

In theory, once all characters are ready, the adventure can start. The following steps are optional, if you're in a hurry, but they can be fun. As for most of character creation, they can also be postponed to during the adventure.

## The Continuum \(optional/may be done later\)

In Ronin Time Bureaucrats, the Continuum behaves pretty much like a NPC:

* It has Aspects, which the players typically describe what kind of adventure they want to play. As usual, these Aspects may be Invoked or Compelled by players and the GM.
* It has a Stress Track and a Consequence Track. In other words, it may be damaged by sufficiently bad Observable Contradictions.
* It doesn't really have Stunts or Skills, as this wouldn't really make sense.

The Continuum is played by all players + GM together, and should be created as such.

### Continuum Aspects

The following Aspect comes with the Setting. It may be invoked and compelled as any other Aspect.

* Trouble: **The Continuum is Fragile**. Examples of compels:
  * Call for a truce between branches of the Bureaucracy, long enough to Explain away an Observable Contradiction or a Consequence.
  * Get a damaged Continuum to Concede, creating an implosive Pocket Continuum.
  * Convince Time Travelers to please not shoot.

Other Aspects are defined exactly like those of PCs. Typical Aspects cover current, past or future events or crisis, but you're welcome to come up with other Aspects. It's generally a good idea to come up with the High Concept immediately, but it's not quite as urgent as for the PCs, so you can delay all these Aspects to later, if you're in a hurry to play.

If you want help from the Time Deck, as usual, you just need to ask.

* _What's the current crisis_?

![](/assets/reversed_small_even10.png)

Apparently, there's a problem with everybody's equipment.

* _What caused that_?

![](/assets/reversed_small_even5.png)

Oh, apparently, someone made Great Progress. So, there was a breakthrough in, say, Continuum Indirection technologies. Everybody is playing catch-up.

* _Who made the breakthrough_?

![](/assets/reversed_small_odd8.png)

Apparently, someone who was planning for the future. Someone who was dug for a very, very long time. It would fit in nicely with Most Benevolent Administrators.

Let's imagine a Most Benevolent Administrator buried for about five-thousand years under Mars, with an army of slaves. It was recently dug up, most likely by the Acquisition Department of the Time Museum, because that's what they do. During these five-thousand years, the Most Benevolent Administrator has come up with a new technology that would somehow revolutionize Continuum Indirections.

Everybody's trying to get into the action!

So, here's our High Concept: _**Everybody's scared of being last to grab the Buried Space·Time Treasure of Mars**_.

Including Space·Time Guerrilla Trotsky, of course.

Let's come up with a second Aspect, which is going to describe a previous crisis. Let's say we ask the Time Deck.

* _What's the previous crisis_?

### ![](/assets/small_odd7.png)

Oops. Madness was afoot.

* _Who was mad_?

![](/assets/small_even10.png)

Apparently, people who were facing the Darkness went crazy. That sounds like an entire branch of the Time Bureaucracy. Before we pick one, let's find out how this crisis was resolved.

* _How was the crisis resolved_?

![](/assets/reversed_small_odd3.png)

Apparently, it was resolved through some pretty energetic show of strength. Could it be that someone blew up a mothership of the Space·Time Fleet? Or perhaps the Space·Time Fleet had to carpet-bomb an entire planet?

* _Who was destroyed_?

![](/assets/reversed_small_even2.png)

The Tower of Babel!

So, let's put this together as _**If the Tower of Babel hadn't been destroyed, the entire Bureaucracy would have gone mad**_. The Crew may or may not know the details of this, but everybody knows that this had to happen, so it's still in everybody's mind.

As usual with Fate Core and Ronin Time Bureaucrats, the players are free to invoke this Aspect for any reason, including giving themselves a role in that crisis. As usual, they may do it at any time during play.

### Continuum Health

The Continuum may be attacked by Observable Contradictions. Just like any character, it may Concede \(which is ok for the Continuum, but bad for the characters\) or be Taken Out \(which is Very, Very Bad for everyone\). On the upside, it may also be healed.

The Continuum has its own Stress Track. It represents Observable Contradictions to the Continuum that may simply be shrugged away. If you wish, Stress may show up, as minor manifestations: pictures fading, books rewriting themselves, etc. Stress Boxes may be ticked to avoid being Taken Out by Contradiction Damage.

The Continuum has its own Consequences Track \(Minor/Moderate/Major\). As for any character, Consequence damage does show up. Each Consequence is an Aspect that alters the Continuum and may be Compelled against any Time Traveler in the vicinity. You are encouraged to come up with possible justifications that explain how things got that bad. Again, Consequences may be taken to avoid being Taken Out by Contradiction Damage.

* Examples of Minor Consequence:

  * _The layout of Time Indirections has changed_. You may have trouble finding things you have stashed, or using the new cockpit. Variants: the clothing of Time Travelers has changed, making it harder for them to walk, or run, or find stuff in their pockets.

  * _Immunization shots are not so good anymore_. You may find yourself getting sick from diseases to which you were previously immune.

* Example of Moderate Consequence:

  * _The Bureaucracy won't answer_. It may have been erased, or maybe the communications technology just doesn't work so well anymore.
  * _Random Time Travelers have been erased from memories_. Doing things is harder when people have trouble remembering that you exist.

* Example of Major Consequence:

  * _The Universe doesn't exist anymore_. Expect any object within your reach to vanish at the worst possible time.

  * _Time Travel has been erased_. Expect the GM to compel your Continuum Indirection to stop working now and then.

  * _Mankind has been erased_. Expect people around you to vanish mid-sentence. Possibly including you, temporarily.

These Tracks are shared by all Time Travellers present at a given Space·Time, whether PCs or NPCs. Consequently, NPCs may be busy both damaging the Continuum and Bandaging it. In fact, attempting to prevent or bandage damage to the Continuum is one of the rare occasions during which pretty much all Time Travelers will show a somewhat united front and suspend backstabbing long enough to avoid Something Very Bad.

If the Continuum is Taken Out, that's a Snafu. That's Really, Really Bad. I personally have no clue what's going to happen, but you're welcome to come up with ideas! Also, please hurt everybody involved – nobody should want another Snafu. Well, nobody except the 0.001%, or that Mad Scientist over there, and perhaps a few Most Benevolent Administrators, oh, and possibly some members of the Time Hierarchy, or some extremists from the Time Purity Patrols, or... Oh, well, it's lucky you're here to fight them, right?

The Continuum may Concede at any time. It may even be Compelled to Concede, by anyone around the table. This creates an implosive Pocket Continuum, trapping any Time Traveler in the vicinity. That's Bad. On the upside, Stress disappears immediately and Consequences are limited to the Pocket Continuum.

The Continuum recovers Stress as soon as it's not being attacked, that is when there are no ongoing Observable Contradictions trying to Take it Out. Recovering from Consequences is slower:

* Recovering from a Minor Consequence only takes a quiet moment.
* Recovering from a Moderate Consequence requires some form of Bandaging the Consequence. Once this is done, recovery will typically take one Scenario. It may even be the topic of that Scenario.

  * Example of a Bandaged Moderate Consequence:

    * _The Bureaucracy won't answer_ becomes _Trouble on the waves_ or _Bureaucracy offices are closed for repairs_. The Bureaucracy is still there, but getting a call through won't be easy.

    * _Random Time Travelers have been erased from memories_ becomes _Passing for a Time Traveler has become easy_. People now remember forgetting Time Travelers and branches of the Bureaucracy are taking advantage to infiltrate each other.

* Recovering from a Major Consequence also requires some form of Bandaging the Consequence. Once this is done, it may take several Scenarios. It may even be the topic of a Campaign.

  * Example of a Bandaged Major Consequence:

    * _The Universe doesn't exist anymore_ becomes _Universe under reconstruction_. Pieces of the Continuum are missing, but Crews of Time Bureaucrats are bringing them back one at a time. Or fighting over them.

    * _Time Travel has been erased_ becomes _Time Travel is coming back_. Most Continuum Indirections are down, possibly including yours. You may have to find a new one before you can do anything about it.

    * _Mankind has been erased_ becomes _Another life-form rules_. Mankind is coming back, one piece of Space·Time at a time. The Time Bureaucracy may even still exist. However, it is now ruled by White Mice from the 15th Dimension.

The simplest way to Bandage a Consequence is to come up with an Explanation of why things are going better. Alternatively, if the players have other ideas, feel free to explore them! Once a Consequence is Bandaged, the Continuum may take a second Consequence of the same level without being Taken Out. Oh, more joy.

## Attack of the Observable Contradictions

So you killed your grandfather, or Adolf Hitler, or destroyed all mammals on Earth before Mankind had a chance to get started. How bad can it be? Well, it can be pretty bad.

Your Observable Contradiction is a NPC and it has exactly one goal: attack the Continuum. The Continuum is now in Conflict, with the Observable Contradiction attacking it at every possible opportunity. And since the Continuum is a non-violent chap, it won't even counter-attack.

\(TBD\)

## Coming up with Explanations

Recall how Time Traveler Tani and Time Traveler Tom were trying to Explain away why killing Time Traveler Tom's Grandfather Gerry before he met Grandmother Gina wasn't such an Observable Contradiction? Well, whenever players are trying to come up with a good reason why something has happened, they can start an **Explanation**. Explanations are a mechanism for putting together very odd chain of causality and making sure that they end up explaining an event – and making sure that it has happened. You may use it both on events that _may_ or _should_ have happened \(for instance, to negate an Observable Contradiction\) and on events that _did_ happen \(in Ronin Time Bureaucrats, it's a perfectly valid way to perform investigations or scientific research\).

Explanations always come in three parts, picked by the players.

1. All the players who wish to participate should mention which of their Aspects is being Compelled. Yep, it's a Compel, so each player gets one Fate Point.
2. Each player picks a skill and rolls against a Good \(+3\) difficulty. The highest winner starts the story \(not necessarily from the beginning\), establishing a temporary Fact, which may not be contradicted in this story. That Fact must be derived from the Aspect compelled and the Skill used. If there is no winner, no Fact gets established. On a Tie, register 1 victory at a Cost. On a Success, register 1 victory. On a Success with Style, register two victories. As usual, Fate Points may be spent, including the use of Help Thyself.
3. All the players who still wish to participate should offer the second part of the explanation and roll against the Success Level _of the previous highest success_. Highest winner picks the second part of the story, establishing a second Fact. Same rules apply.
4. All the players who still wish to participate should offer the final part of the explanation and roll against the Success Level _of the previous highest success_. Highest winner picks the second part of the story, establishing a final Fact. Same rules apply.
5. If at least three victories were scored, an Explanation is coming. Each player picks a skill and rolls. Highest score gets to determine the Explanation. It must involve all the Facts established previously and the skill just rolled. This Explanation, no matter how handwavy, becomes _an Established Fact of the Continuum_. If less than three victories were scored, the event remains uncertain and/or unexplained.

> **Note**
>
> Explanations are one of the reasons why a GM of Ronin Time Bureaucrats should not spend too much time coming with sophisticated plots. The rules are _designed_ to let the players derail any story.

Here's an example Explanation:

* Grandmother Greta was a drunk who had no clue who Time Traveler Tom’s grandfather really was.

* Someone took a picture of \(not-really-\) Grandfather Gerry and convinced Grandmother Greta that this was the real Grandfather – the roll wasn’t really good enough, but Time Traveler Tom is willing to spend one Fate Point to ensure that his Future Self will do it, so he got to reroll.

* Grandmother Greta always told Mother Maria that Grandfather Gerry was a violent man, so Mother Maria never attempted to get in touch with him.

If the Explanation suffices to dispel an Observable Contradiction \(or a Consequence, etc.\), that's good!

If the Explanation actually introduces a new Observable Contradiction, not so good!

If less than three victories were scored, there is no Established Fact, so any Observable Contradiction \(or Consequence, etc.\) that should have been handwaved away remains present. Also, if this is an Observable Contradiction, the attempt to Explain it away was an interaction with the Observable Contradiction, so the Observable Contradiction gets their Attack on the Continuum.

## Crew & Indirection

There is also a Character Sheet for the Crew and its Indirection. Are you a band of merry companions? A mercenary company forged in the fire of Mercury? Time bank robbers? Is your Indirection larger in the inside? Well, that's where you turn this all into Aspects and Stunts.

That's also where the Indirection can gets damaged.
