# The Time Deck

The Time Deck is a tool for improvising and brainstorming ideas, situations, outcomes, characters, places, descriptions...

Although game can be played with Time Deck alone, it is generally not meant to replace your favorite ruleset. Think of it as a some kind of Divination Tarot, except you're using it for coming up with ideas inside a game, not doing whatever people who use Divination Decks do with it in real life.

## Introducing The Time Deck

The Time Deck consists in 22 cards, loosely inspired from the Major Arcana of a Divination Tarot Deck.

All images are believed to allow reproduction and reuse.

## Using The Time Deck

There are very few rules to using the Time Deck:

1. The Time Deck is about getting ideas, so there are no hard rules.
2. Anybody can use the Time Deck whenever they're looking for an idea.
3. Don't forget to shuffle it, once in a while.
4. When you pick a card, choose its orientation before looking at it, then place it on the table.
5. Look at the picture, the title, the question mark facing you.
6. If you have an idea, use it.
7. If you don't have any idea, don't hesitate to ask around the table.
8. Ignore all these rules as you see fit.

### ...in a dungeon

As things are bound to happen, your Time Traveling Crew is being pursued by giant, pixellated Pac-Man Ghosts in the underground tunnels below the Castle of Arthur Pendragon. Just another day in the life of a Ronin Time Bureaucrat. Of course, the GM has no map for the dungeon, because how could have guessed that the Crew would decide to dig below the crypt by shoveling earth and rock through time and space using their Continuum Indirection?

Ok, so the Crew is running like madpeople and eventually stumbles upon a deadend. Wait, just a deadend? That's not very interesting. Let's draw a card. And the card is...

![](/assets/reversed_small_even5.png)

So, we may decide to use **Great Progress?**, **X. Leaping like a Giant!** and/or that weird human-faced moon with a bullet in its eye.  Personally, I'd like to use **Leaping like a Giant!**, and interpret it as "_After following that corridor for a hundred meters or so, you suddenly enter a giant cavern, much larger than anything you had seen below the castle so far. Unfortunately, that cavern is barred by a huge chasm, much too large for any human to jump_."

Also, let's add some flavor/plot hook based on the illustration: "_On the other side of the chasm, you barely see the outline of something that looks like a round statue head, facing you. It appears that the statue is winking at you._"

Oh, wait a second. A round statue head? While being hunted by Pac-Man Ghosts? This just has to be Pac-Man. Here you go, you just got a new plot hook.

For the moment, the Pac-Man Ghosts are arriving, so it's time for the Crew to do something!

### ...designing a NPC

So, while the Queen of Chandernagor is waiting for the Ambassador of Shangrila to land, the Crew has decided to rollback time, scout ahead and investigate around the seediest part of Chandernagor, looking for anything that could help the Ambassador negotiate a better peace treaty. So, here they are, finally facing their contact... whom the GM knows nothing about, because that entire story was supposed to be an escort mission starting only after the Ambassador landed.

Let's first draw one card to determine what the contact looks like:

![](/assets/small_even8.png)

Ok, no need to go much further. The contact is a human being \(let's say female-looking\) "_with an extremely sophisticated hat that looks like an umbrella and a feather, as well as a moving cape that looks extremely uncomfortable for walking. Also, spines on her back_."

Now, what does the NPC want?

![](/assets/reversed_small_even1.png)

This NPC is obviously into partying \(maybe the meeting point is some kind of garden party/orgy?\) and might be after something related to **Innocence?**, so something related to the judicial system of Chandernagor. Maybe that person wants information to exonerate a jailed relative? Or wants help to break someone out of jail? Or we can put all of this together: someone the NPC knows is prisoner of their own dreams, trapped by some drug, and she's after a cure that the Crew will need to steal or barter or promise to get her cooperation.

### ...designing a place

So, after deftly eloping with the bomb and made sure that it explodes in their ship instead of in the crowded city, the Crew is shipwrecked on yet another alien planet. Quick, what does the planet look like?

![](/assets/small_even0.png)

Oh, joy, it's an enigma! Obviously, a planet filled with puzzles and brain-teasers. So "A_s you exit your escape pod, you stumble upon the remainings of a huge cardboard statue of a bull-headed children-friendly creature. You seem to be in the middle of some kind of glass labyrinth. Judging from the music, it looks like you have landed in some kind of amusement park! Apparently, you've done some damage while landing._"

Let's add some flavor

![](/assets/small_odd4.png)

So, an obstacle overlooked, people drowning in the sea...

"_Might be quite some damage, indeed, if you hear the panicked screams that somehow manage to drown the music. Looking at your feet, you see water. It's at ankle-level, but you could swear that there was no water a few seconds ago. Oh, yeah, memory confirmed by observation: it's rising pretty fast. What do you do?_"

## &c...

Truly, there are no limits to what you can do with the Time Deck. Use it whenever there is a lull in the story, or to explain why one of the players couldn't join today, or how a new player + character managed to join while you were obviously alone in a locked chamber, etc.

If you feel like it, you can even use the Time Deck in place of dice resolution. Assume that the action succeeds-by-default if the character has sufficient points, fails-by-default otherwise, then draw a card and describe what happens. Any success can be turned into a failure with the right card, and vice-versa.

As usual, remember that the objective is to have fun, so make sure that everybody is on the same wavelength!
