# The Time Deck

The Time Deck is a tool for improvising and brainstorming ideas, situations, outcomes, characters, places, descriptions...

Although game can be played with Time Deck alone, it is generally not meant to replace your favorite ruleset. Think of it as a some kind of Divination Tarot, except you're using it for coming up with ideas inside a game, not doing whatever you believe you're doing with a Divination Deck in real life.

## Introducing The Time Deck

The Time Deck consists in 22 cards, loosely inspired from the Major Arcana of a Divination Tarot Deck.
