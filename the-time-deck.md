# The Time Deck

The Time Deck is a tool for improvising and brainstorming ideas, situations, outcomes, characters, places, descriptions...

Although Ronin Time Bureaucrats can be played with Time Deck alone, the Time Deck is generally not meant to replace your favorite ruleset. That's because the single use of the Time Deck is: _if you need an idea, draw a card, see if it inspires you_.

This chapter consists in the cards themselves, and a few examples on how to use them.

## Introducing The Time Deck

The Time Deck consists in 22 cards, loosely inspired from the Major Arcana of a Divination Tarot Deck.

All images are believed to allow reproduction and reuse.

As you can see, each card has:

* an image;
* a title;
* two default \(generally opposite\) interpretations.

We'll use all of them for improvisation.

As a minigame, you can try and find what each of these pictures represents and how they're related to their title and interpretations.

## Using The Time Deck

There are very few rules to using the Time Deck:

1. The Time Deck is about getting ideas, so there are no hard rules.
2. Anybody can use the Time Deck whenever they're looking for an idea.
3. Don't forget to shuffle it, once in a while.
4. When you pick a card, choose its orientation before looking at it, then place it on the table.
5. Look at the picture, the title, the question mark facing you.
6. If you have an idea, use it.
7. If you don't have any idea, don't hesitate to ask around the table.
8. You can draw more than one card.
9. Ignore all these rules as you see fit.

### ...in a dungeon

As things are bound to happen, your Time Traveling Crew is being pursued by giant, pixellated Pac-Man Ghosts in the underground tunnels below the Castle of Arthur Pendragon. Just another day in the life of a Ronin Time Bureaucrat. Of course, the GM has no map for the dungeon, because how could have guessed that the Crew would decide to dig below the crypt by shoveling earth and rock through time and space using their Continuum Indirection?

Ok, so the Crew is running like madpeople and eventually stumbles upon a deadend. Wait, just a deadend? That's not very interesting. Let's draw a card. And the card is...

![](/assets/reversed_small_even5.png)

So, we may decide to use **Great Progress?**, **X. Leaping like a Giant!** and/or that weird human-faced moon with a bullet in its eye.  Personally, I'd like to use **Leaping like a Giant!**, and interpret it as "_After following that corridor for a hundred meters or so, you suddenly enter a giant cavern, much larger than anything you had seen below the castle so far. Unfortunately, that cavern is barred by a huge chasm, much too large for any human to jump_."

Also, let's add some flavor/plot hook based on the illustration: "_On the other side of the chasm, you barely see the outline of something that looks like a round statue head, facing you. It appears that the statue is winking at you._"

Oh, wait a second. A round statue head? While being hunted by Pac-Man Ghosts? This just has to be Pac-Man. Here you go, you just got a new plot hook.

For the moment, the Pac-Man Ghosts are arriving, so it's time for the Crew to do something!

### ...designing a NPC

So, while the Queen of Chandernagor is waiting for the Ambassador of Shangrila to land, the Crew has decided to rollback time, scout ahead and investigate around the seediest part of Chandernagor, looking for anything that could help the Ambassador negotiate a better peace treaty. So, here they are, finally facing their contact... whom the GM knows nothing about, because that entire story was supposed to be an escort mission starting only after the Ambassador landed.

Let's first draw one card to determine what the contact looks like:

![](/assets/small_even8.png)

Ok, no need to go much further. The contact is a human being \(let's say female-looking\) "_with an extremely sophisticated hat that looks like an umbrella and a feather, as well as a moving cape that looks extremely uncomfortable for walking. Also, spines on her back_."

Now, what does the NPC want?

![](/assets/reversed_small_even1.png)

This NPC is obviously into partying \(maybe the meeting point is some kind of garden party/orgy?\) and might be after something related to **Innocence?**, so something related to the judicial system of Chandernagor. Maybe that person wants information to exonerate a jailed relative? Or wants help to break someone out of jail? Or we can put all of this together: someone the NPC knows is prisoner of their own dreams, trapped by some drug, and she's after a cure that the Crew will need to steal or barter or promise to get her cooperation.

### ...designing a place

So, after deftly eloping with the bomb and made sure that it explodes in their ship instead of in the crowded city, the Crew is shipwrecked on yet another alien planet. Quick, what does the planet look like?

![](/assets/small_even0.png)

Oh, joy, it's an enigma! Obviously, a planet filled with puzzles and brain-teasers. So "A_s you exit your escape pod, you stumble upon the remainings of a huge cardboard statue of a bull-headed children-friendly creature. You seem to be in the middle of some kind of glass labyrinth. Judging from the music, it looks like you have landed in some kind of amusement park! Apparently, you've done some damage while landing._"

Note that if the card had been facing **Mysteries?**, the players might instead have been instead landed on some kind of holy planet, or inside a cathedral.

Let's add some flavor

![](/assets/small_odd4.png)

So, an obstacle overlooked, people drowning in the sea...

"_Might be quite some damage, indeed, if you hear the panicked screams that somehow manage to drown the music. Looking at your feet, you see water. It's at ankle-level, but you could swear that there was no water a few seconds ago. Oh, yeah, memory confirmed by observation: it's rising pretty fast. What do you do?_"

## ...desiging a plot

Quick, the players are coming and no prep has been done. I can heir their coming up the stairs!

A good plot needs:

* a place;
* a hook;
* a stake.

#### The place

![](/assets/small_even4.png)

Apparently, it's a battlefield, or some kind of revolution. Given the flag, it could be a French Revolution, but let's draw a second card to keep it surprising.

![](/assets/small_odd7.png)

Ok, so the story is set in a madhouse, during an uprising. Or maybe a madhouse in which political opponents are kept? Let's combine both: _the story is set a psychiatric clinic, designed to renormalize the opponents to the regime, but during a riot_.

#### The hook

![](/assets/reversed_small_odd0.png)

So something new is born. Possibly a new life-form, or a new technology, or a new type of government. Let's see what

![](/assets/small_odd4.png)

Moses crossing the Red Sea? Ok, so it's obviously a new religion. Or perhaps a god? Nah, let's stick with religion.

So, a new religion is being born in that psychiatric clinic. Maybe this can be connected with an existing religion or antagonist that the Crew has encountered in a previous Mission. Maybe the Crew is interested in anthropology. Let's wait for the stake until we commit to a specific manner of involving the Crew.

#### The stake

So, what's at stake? Well, the religion is already a lot, but let's ask the Deck:

![](/assets/small_even2.png)

Ahah, communications trouble!

So,_ in some future, that religion will manage to erase all information on &lt;insert something of interest to your Crew&gt;. Apparently, this has been a dogma since the first day of the religion. Which explains why the Crew will need to time-travel to that specific psychiatric clinic, during that specific riot, to witness the birth of that religion and find out why this &lt;insert something of interest to your Crew&gt; needs to be erased from memories_.

We got ourselves a plot!

## &c...

Truly, as there are no rules, there are no limits to what you can do with the Time Deck. Use it whenever there is a lull in the story, or to explain why one of the players couldn't join today, or how a new player + character managed to join while you were obviously alone in a locked chamber, to help a player with character creation, etc.

If you feel like it, you can even use the Time Deck in place of dice resolution. Assume that the action succeeds-by-default if the character has sufficient points, fails-by-default otherwise, then draw a card and describe what happens. Any success can be turned into a failure with the right card, and vice-versa.

Or, simply, use the numbers on the deck as a random number generator.

As usual, remember that the objective is to have fun, so make sure that everybody is on the same wavelength!
