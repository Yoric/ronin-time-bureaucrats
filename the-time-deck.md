# The Time Deck

The Time Deck is a tool for improvising and brainstorming ideas, situations, outcomes, characters, places, descriptions...

Although game can be played with Time Deck alone, it is generally not meant to replace your favorite ruleset. Think of it as a some kind of Divination Tarot, except you're using it for coming up with ideas inside a game, not doing whatever people who use Divination Decks do with it in real life.

## Introducing The Time Deck

The Time Deck consists in 22 cards, loosely inspired from the Major Arcana of a Divination Tarot Deck.

## Using The Time Deck

There are very few rules to using the Time Deck:

1. Anybody can use the Time Deck whenever they're looking for an idea.
2. Don't forget to shuffle it, once in a while.
3. When you pick a card, choose its orientation before looking at it, then place it on the table.
4. Look at the picture, the title, the question mark facing you.
5. If you have an idea, use it.
6. If you don't have any idea, don't hesitate to ask around the table.
7. Ignore all these rules as you see fit.

### ...in a dungeon

As things are bound to happen, your Time Traveling Crew is being pursued by giant, pixellated Pac-Man Ghosts in the underground tunnels below the Castle of Arthur Pendragon. Just another day in the life of a Ronin Time Bureaucrat. Of course, the GM has no map for the dungeon, because how could have guessed that the Crew would decide to dig below the crypt by shoveling earth and rock through time and space using their Continuum Indirection?

Ok, so the Crew is running like madpeople and eventually stumbles upon a deadend. Wait, just a deadend? That's not very interesting. Let's draw a card. The card is... **X. Leaping like a Giant**, showing **Great Progress?**, and it represents a human-faced moon with a rocket in its eye.
