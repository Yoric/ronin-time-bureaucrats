# The Polyphonic Choir

As in most Ronin Time Bureaucracy stories, the number of possibilities afforded to the Crew is endless, so don't expect a well-delimited plot. Rather, this scenario introduces a few basic places, aspects and characters, and lets the Crew and GM improvise from it.

## The setting

This story is set in the Ancient Greek city of Euthermios. If you haven't heard about that city, well, there's probably a good reason...

Aspects

* Holy City of the Ancients.
* &lt;What your characters are doing here&gt;
* The Plague walks the streets.
