# The Polyphonic Choir

As in most Ronin Time Bureaucracy stories, the number of possibilities afforded to the Crew is endless, so don't expect a well-delimited plot. Rather, this scenario introduces a few basic places, aspects and characters, and lets the Crew and GM improvise from it. It can serve as an introduction to the Brick Nation and/or a pathway to unleashing the Brick Nation through Time and Space.

## The setting

This story is set in the Ancient Greek city of Euthermios. If you haven't heard about that city, well, there's probably a good reason... Until a few weeks ago, this city was a major cultural and commercial node in the Greek Civilization. It overlooks the sea, controls a river known as the &lt;?&gt;, and is home to one of the greatest libraries of the Mediterranean, natural hot baths, as well as no less than ten temples to the various Gods known and lost, a volcanic crater rumoured to hide an entrance to the Land of the Dead, and a fabled Colossus. Philosophers, merchants and pilgrims came from all over the Mediterranean Sea and the Greek Peninsula to exchange, barter, pray and have their future read. According to legends, this is where Herakles defeated the dreaded Tricorn and buried it somewhere. Of course, at the best of times, this is also a city of slavery, one that smells of the piss and sweat of ten thousand human beings \(a true metropolis\), even when it's not beset by mosquitoes.

> **Why are the characters here?**
>
> A few ideas:
>
> * the usual "let's visit a fun part of time & space";
> * the just as usual distress signal/ship malfunction/that's not where we aimed to land \(quite possibly because of the Interdictor, see below\)
> * the Crew has found a manuscript about this city, except no other archive seems to ever mention the city, and they are after a mystery;
> * appointment with a smuggler \(Alfredo Jester is a good candidate, see below\);
> * bounty hunting through time and space \(for instance Alfredo Jester or the Tricorn\);
> * one of the Crew is afflicted with some ill, and the temples of Euthermios were rumored to be able to cure all diseases;
> * looking for a vanished Crew of the Time Brigade \(see below\), either as a rescue mission, as a search & destroy mission, as an opportunity to steal some Time Brigade technology, looking for conveniently missing time travelers to sustain a Pocket Continuum, ...;
> * ...
>
> As usual, the only limit is the Entirety of Time and Space. Just remember the reason and make it an Aspect of the story.

During the last two weeks, however, the situation has changed considerably. It started with a sick pilgrim, or a sick priest, or perhaps a rat in the granary. A few days later, dozens of people were walking the streets, complaining about their cracking, dry skin, their falling teeth, eyes they could barely keep open. Now, thousands are dead or dying. Survivors are starving in temples guarded by archers, or hiding in their houses. Those who have attempted to escape report mythical monsters besieging the city. Also, the night has new noises. Yellow ones.

## Around the city

The city can easily be reached from a well-travelled dirt road, from the sea \(staying close to the land â€“ Greek ships aren't too good and Greek sailors don't like to take chances\), the river. With more efforts, the Crew can also travel off-road or even cross through the marshes \(good luck with the mosquitoes\).

### Travelers in Greece

Coming from the dirt road, from the sea or the river is pretty much the same story: the Crew will encounter a group of ~50 merchants, pilgrims, philosophers and slaves \(also, possibly sailors\), most of them male, traveling away from the city in a hurry. The leader of the group is a merchant called Eurystheus of Athens. The travelers intended to reach the city a few days ago, but they heard of monsters blocking the path, so they decided to wait here while the twin sons of Eurystheus scouted ahead \(even if the travellers were on a ship, the sons scouted from the land\).

The two young men \(teenagers, in fact\) have just returned with word of a man-eating, fire-breathing bull laying in ambush and/or a gigantic, many-eyed sea monster devouring ships. According to them, both monsters have killed so many brave men that they are surrounded by flocks of carrion birds, waiting for the next prey to fall into their hands/tentacles. The teenagers are still flush with their adventure and their tale grows with each retelling. In the meantime, the merchants are discussing the best place to travel to sell their wares, the philosophers try to make sense of what is happening, and the pilgrims moan to the Gods. The travellers seem to take the loss reasonably well, though, and are pretty easy to discuss with. Promises of riches will, of course, help chat with merchants, mystery hunting and logical questioning will help with the philosophers, adventure with the teenagers, etc. The travelers will generally try and convince the Crew not to venture towards the city, but won't insist if the Crew is bent on going towards their deaths.

### Forcing the blockade



## In the city

If the Crew land within the city, they will immediately realize that the streets are near empty. A few dying inhabitants and animals, but no dead.

FIXME: No locks
