# The Yellow Choir

As in most Ronin Time Bureaucracy stories, the number of possibilities afforded to the Crew is endless, so don't expect a well-delimited plot. Rather, this scenario introduces a few basic places, aspects and characters, and lets the Crew and GM improvise from it. It can serve as an introduction to the Brick Nation and/or a pathway to unleashing the Brick Nation through Time and Space.

Rather than a linear adventure, you'll find **summaries of information** available at places.

## Synopsis

The story is set in and around the city of Euthermios, in Ancient Greece. An outbreak of Plague is killing its inhabitants, while mythological monsters are besieging the city, preventing anyone from coming in or escaping. It goes without saying that both the Plague and the Monsters have Time-Traveling origins. The Monsters are fakes, put together by a Political Officer of the Time Brigade as soon as he realized the gravity of this Plague, in an effort to avoid Snafuing mankind and the universe. Oh, and the Plague is not technically a disease: rather, it is a an advanced cloud of nanobots, designed to _brickiform_ entire cities, turning its objects into plastic bricks and its inhabitants into toy-like Brick Figs.

> A few ideas:
>
> * the usual "let's visit a fun part of time & space";
> * the just as usual distress signal/ship malfunction/that's not where we aimed to land \(quite possibly because of the Interdictor, see below\)
> * the Crew has found a manuscript about this city, except no other archive seems to ever mention the city, and they are after a mystery;
> * appointment with a smuggler \(Alfredo Jester is a good candidate, see below\);
> * bounty hunting through time and space \(for instance Alfredo Jester or the Tricorn\);
> * one of the Crew is afflicted with some ill, and the temples of Euthermios were rumored to be able to cure all diseases;
> * looking for a vanished Crew of the Time Brigade \(see below\), either as a rescue mission, as a search 
>   &
>    destroy mission, as an opportunity to steal some Time Brigade technology, looking for conveniently missing time travelers to sustain a Pocket Continuum, ...;
> * ...
>
> As usual, the only limit is the Entirety of Time and Space. Just remember the reason and make it an Aspect of the story.

To save Ancient Greece – and the Continuum itself – the Crew will need to find a way to deal with both the locals, the Time Brigade, and a vaguely threatening Time Smuggler, while finding a way to either defeat the Plague, negotiate with it, or somehow deflect it to another time and place.

## The City of Euthermios

This story is set in the Ancient Greek city of Euthermios. If you haven't heard about that city, well, there's probably a good reason... Until a few weeks ago, this city was a major cultural and commercial node in the Greek Civilization. It overlooks the sea, controls a river known as the Lakedon, and is home to one of the greatest libraries of the Mediterranean, natural hot baths, as well as no less than ten temples to the various Gods known and lost, a volcanic crater rumoured to hide an entrance to the Land of the Dead, and a fabled Colossus. Philosophers, merchants and pilgrims came from all over the Mediterranean Sea and the Greek Peninsula to exchange, barter, pray and have their future read. According to legends, this is where Herakles defeated the dreaded Tricorn and buried it somewhere. Of course, at the best of times, this is also a city of slavery, one that smells of the piss and sweat of ten thousand human beings \(a true metropolis\), even when it's not beset by mosquitoes.

During the last two weeks, however, the situation has changed considerably. It started with a sick pilgrim, or a sick priest, or perhaps a rat in the granary. A few days later, dozens of people were walking the streets, complaining about their cracking, dry skin, their falling teeth, eyes they could barely keep open. Now, thousands are dead or dying. Survivors are starving in temples guarded by archers, or hiding in their houses. Those who have attempted to escape report mythical monsters besieging the city. Also, the night has new noises. Yellow ones.

A few places the Crew may wish to visit:

* The road to the city.
* The marshes.
* The city walls.
* The sea.
* The port.
* The river.
* A dozen temples.
* The Time Brigade Citadel \(once the Crew has found it\).
* The crater.
* The Colossus.
* ## Around the city

The city can easily be reached from a well-travelled dirt road, from the sea \(staying close to the land – Greek ships aren't too good and Greek sailors don't like to take chances\), the river. With more efforts, the Crew can also travel off-road or even cross through the marshes \(good luck with the mosquitoes\).

Aspects:

* Nobody gets in, nobody gets out.
* Killer heat, killer mosquitoes.

### Travelers in Greece

Coming from the dirt road, from the sea or the river is pretty much the same story: the Crew will encounter a group of ~50 merchants, pilgrims, philosophers and slaves \(also, possibly sailors\), most of them male, traveling away from the city in a hurry. The leader of the group is a merchant called Eurystheus of Athens. The travelers intended to reach the city a few days ago, but they heard of monsters blocking the path, so they decided to wait here while the twin sons of Eurystheus scouted ahead \(even if the travellers were on a ship, the sons scouted from the land\).

The two young men \(teenagers, in fact\) have just returned with word of a man-eating, fire-breathing bull laying in ambush and/or a gigantic, many-eyed sea monster devouring ships. According to them, both monsters have killed so many brave men that they are surrounded by flocks of carrion birds, waiting for the next prey to fall into their hands/tentacles. The teenagers are still flush with their adventure and their tale grows with each retelling. In the meantime, the merchants are discussing the best place to travel to sell their wares, the philosophers try to make sense of what is happening, and the pilgrims moan to the Gods. The travellers seem to take the loss reasonably well, though, and are pretty easy to discuss with. Promises of riches will, of course, help chat with merchants, mystery hunting and logical questioning will help with the philosophers, adventure with the teenagers, etc. The travelers will generally try and convince the Crew not to venture towards the city, but won't insist if the Crew is bent on going towards their deaths.

If the Crew attempts to travel through the marshes or off-road, they will actually meet the twin teenagers heading back to the camp with the same story.

### Getting in through the blockade

Once the Crew has decided to ignore the warnings, they can approach the city. Within sight of the Walls, they will witness some mythological monster eating alive a dozen of warriors or sailors, surrounded by black crows. No matter what path they take to approach the city \(including flying\), they will encounter a monster. Interestingly, the monsters leave no bodies, and if the Crew attempts to find where the victims come from, they will realize that said victims left no traces. Alternatively, if they wait long enough, the Crew may realize that _the exact same victims_ get eaten each time. Also, any sufficiently advanced recording equipment will quickly help the Crew conclude that victims and monsters are in fact holographic projections.

In fact, the monsters are no threat. They have been set here as part of the blockade to scare travelers in an attempt to limit the plague. The crows, however, are customized Crowd Control Clockworks of the Time Brigade. As such, they are equipped with stun tasers and a rudimentary memory-wipe mechanism meant to convince travelers that they have barely escaped with their life. Should the Crew be memory-wiped, the crude illusion won't stand for more than a few minutes.

> **The Monsters**
>
> * Nothing but an illusion
>
> Good at: Scaring people to death.  
> Poor at: Pretty much everything else.
>
> Robustness: Pretty much unkillable.
>
> **Crowd Control Crows**
>
> * Hidden among illusions.
> * Easy to spot, hard to catch.
> * Limitless numbers.
>
>   Robustness: Mook.
>
> Good at: Flying, tasing, spotting travelers.  
> Poor at: Being smart, fighting determined opposition, dealing with time travelers, being resilient to damage.

Stealth will let the Crew past the Crows. Putting up too much of a fight before falling will cause the Crew to be spotted as time travelers and wake up in a cell of the Time Brigade. Being spotted as time travelers but not captured, or damaging too many Crowd Control Crows, will cause one of the monster illusions to actually ask politely the Crew to cease and desist: the city is under quarantine due to a deadly plague and bringing in any Time Traveler would be a Very Bad idea. Should the Crew prove determined, the monsters will deliver an invitation to the Citadel in the center of the City. Examining a destroyed Crow will let the Crew find out that they belong to the Time Brigade.

Getting past the the three-meter tall walls themselves may offer a minor challenge to the Crew, but nothing that should hold them for long. As the plague started spreading, a traveling philosopher named Tymon has concluded that the city was lost and that nobody should be allowed to leave Euthermios and travel to other cities. He has sent is disciples to the city walls to try and convince the local garrison to enforce this blockade. While some of the officers and soldiers have preferred running either away from the city or towards their families, three dozen archers are manning the walls to try and prevent anybody from spreading the plague. By now, they are exhausted and hungry, which makes them both more irritated and less efficient, but they are determined to hold. Note that they are looking for people who might attempt to sneak out of the city, rather than people sneaking in, which should simplify the life of the Crew. It might be possible to negotiate with them.

> **The Men on the Wall**
>
> * Determined to hold.
> * Hungry, tired and irritated.
> * Nothing to lose.
>
> Robustness: Mook \(unless given an opportunity to rest and rearm\).
>
> Good at: Spotting people sneaking out of the city, shooting, close combat.
>
> Poor at: Spotting people sneaking into the city, being sufficiently numerous to cover the entire wall, communicating.

> **Agatone, Last Commander of the Wall**
>
> * Seasoned soldier, broken man.
> * I will fall last.
>
> Robustness: Underboss.
>
> Good at: Strategy.
>
> Poor at: Living with the consequences of his choices.



> **Summary of information**
>
> * Travelers can't get into the city because of monsters.
> * Monsters are illusory, but backed by Crows.
> * Crows belong to the Time Brigade.

### Getting out

Should the Crew attempt to get out of the city without the authorization of the Time Brigade, things may get complicated for them.

The walls and archers are still there, and they have higher chances of spotting the Crew.

Attempting to get out of the city is more complicated than getting it. Same walls, same archers, same monsters, same crows, but increased surveillance using the sophisticated monitoring of the Time Brigade. Also, the Time Brigade may customize its illusions, deploy reinforcements instantaneously, including one or two Polymorphic Provocateurs customized to actually look and behave like mythological monsters, as well as deploy its own crew with advanced technological weapons.

## In Euthermios

If the Crew lands within the city, or once they have forced the blockade, they will immediately realize that the streets are pretty much empty. Survivors hide in temples or in their houses. Interestingly, there are no dead bodies anywhere.

A few dying inhabitants and animals, but no dead.

FIXME: No locks
